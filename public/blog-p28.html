    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Due to my cursory reading in the <em>Perl Cookbook, 2nd Edition</em>,
    earlier this week, I've been investigating the <tt>use autouse</tt> pragma,
    to see if it will indeed solve my issue of wanting to use different modules
    based on the current situation. Unfortunately, I cannot find any
    documentation on it in <tt>perldoc</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    I remember seeing something about wrapping this stuff into a <tt>BEGIN</tt>
    block, but that would require knowing certain information immediately, and I
    might need the code to work through some steps before getting there.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=323606">this
        node</a> just appeared on Perl Monks today, and I got to see other ways
    of doing it:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <tt>if</tt> module lets you do something like <tt>use if $type eq
        'x', "Some::Module";</tt> However, $type must be known at compile time
        (i.e., it's based on system info or on @ARGV); this probably wouldn't
        work in a web-based application.
    </li>
    <li>Use <tt>require</tt> and <tt>import</tt> instead: <tt>if $type wq 'ex')
        { require Some::Module; Some::Module->import if
        Some::Module->can("import"); }</tt> If your module doesn't export
        anything, you can even omit the call to <tt>import</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>Use an <tt>eval</tt>: <tt>if ($type eq 'x') { eval "use Some::Module";
        }</tt> This gets around the <tt>import</tt> problem, but could possibly
        run into other compile time issues.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    So, basically, I already had the tools to do the job; just needed to examine
    the problem more.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    So, I'm a bit of an idiot... it's been so long since I looked at CGI::App,
    and yet I felt I had such a grasp on it, that I overlooked the obvious step:
    look at the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Ejerlbaum/CGI-Application-3.1/Application.pm">manual!</a>
</p>
<p>
    In particular, there's a whole series of methods that are used to tailor
    CGI:App to your particular needs, and these include <em>cgiapp_init(),
        cgiapp_prerun(), and cgiapp_postrun()</em>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>cgiapp_init()</b> is used to perform application specific
        initialization behaviour, and is called immediately before the setup()
        method. It can be used to load settings from elsewhere; if it were
        called only from a superclass from which other modules inherited, it
        would then provide common settings for all modules.
    </li>
    <li><b>cgiapp_prerun()</b> is called immediately before the selected
        run-mode. If it were called only by your superclass, you could perform
        items such as authorization or even form validation; this would then be
        standard for all your applications. (You can use the
        $self->prerun_mode('mode') call to to override the selected run-mode,
        for instance, thus allowing you to redirect to a different mode if a
        user isn't permitted there.)
    </li>
    <li><b>cgiapp_postrun()</b> is called after the run-mode has returned its
        output, but before http headers have been generated or anything sent to
        the web browser. Again, if defined in a superclass, it means that you
        could then place the run-mode output <em>in a specific place within a
            larger template</em>, and even call other routines to fill in other
        parts of the main template. You could even check to see if certain
        parameters were passed to the page, and change the type of output you
        send back (XML, PDF, image, etc.), allowing you to have a common query
        element that changes the output type (e.g., a 'print' parameter that
        returns a PDF or a stripped down template).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, you could specify in the superclass that you're using
    CGI::Simple for the query object (using the <em>cgiapp_get_query</em>
    method), or you could rewrite the <em>load_tmpl()</em> method to use
    Template::Toolkit or some other templating system, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Doesn't look so crazy anymore...

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/17-CGIApplication-Research.html">CGI::Application Research</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been wanting to redevelop my home website for some time using
    CGI::Application. The last time I rewrote it from PHP to perl, I developed
    something that was basically a subset of the things CGI::App does, and those
    things weren't done nearly as well.
</p>
<p>
    The problem I've been running into has to do with having sidebar content,
    and wanting to run basically a variety of applications. I want to have a
    WikiWikiWeb, a photo gallery, some mail forms, and an article database/blog;
    CGI::App-based modules for each of these all exist. But I want them all to
    utilize the same sidebar content, as well -- and that sidebar content may
    vary based on the user.
</p>
<p>
    My interest got sparked by <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=320946">this node</a> on
    <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a>. The author tells of an
    acquaintance who goes by the rule that a CGI::App should have 10-12 states
    at most; more than that, and you need to either break it apart or rethink
    your design. And all CGI::Apps inherit from a common superclass, so that
    they share the same DB connections, templates, etc.
</p>
<p>
    So, I've been investigating this problem. <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=229260">One node on PM</a>
    notes that his ISP uses CGI::App with hundreds of run modes spread across
    many applications; they created a module for session management and access
    control that calls <tt>use base CGI::Application</tt>; each aplication then
    calls <tt>use base Control</tt>, and they all automatically have that same
    session management and access, as well as CGI::Application.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=94879">Another node</a>
    mentions the same thing, but gives a little more detail. That author writes
    a module per application, each inheriting from a super class:
    UserManager.pm, Survey.pm, RSS.pm, Search.pm, etc. You create an API for
    that super class, and each CGI::App utilizes that API to do its work.
</p>
<p>
    This also seems to be the idea behind <a href="http://cheesepizza.venzia.com">CheesePizza</a>, a CGI::App-based
    framework for building applications. (All pizzas start out as cheese pizzas;
    you simply add ingredients.) The problem with that, though, is that I have
    to learn another framework on top of CGI::App, instead of intuiting my own.
</p>
<p>
    But how do I write the superclass? Going back to the original node that
    sparked my interest, I found a <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=321064">later reply</a>
    that described how you do this. The big key is that you override the
    <tt>print</tt> method -- this allows you to customize the output, and from
    here you could call functions that create your sidebar blocks, and output
    the content of the CGI::App you just called in a main content area of your
    template.
</p>
<p>
    Grist for the mill...

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    One thing I've wondered about is the syntax of the robots.txt file, where
    it's placed, and how it's used. I've known that it is used to block spiders
    from accessing your site, but that's about it. I've had to look into it
    recently because we're offering free memberships at work, and we don't want
    them indexed by search engines. I've also wondered how we can exclude
    certain areas, such as where we collate our site statistics, from these
    engines.
</p>
<p>
    As it turns out, it's really dead simple. Simply create a
    <tt>robots.txt</tt> file in your htmlroot, and the syntax is as follows:
</p>
<pre>User-agent: *
Disallow: /path/
Disallow: /path/to/file
</pre>
<p>
    The <tt>User-agent</tt> can specify specific agents or the wildcard; there
    are so many spiders out there, it's probably safest to simply disallow all
    of them. The <tt>Disallow</tt> line should have only one path or name, but
    you can have multiple <tt>Disallow</tt> lines, so you can exclude any number
    of paths or files.

<ul>
    <li>Press Enter</li>
    <li>Type ~C</li>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was just reading an <a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7372&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0">article
        about the Dean campaign's IT infrastructure</a>, and there's an
    interesting quote from their IT manager, Harish Rao:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "I believe in three principles", he said. "First I always make sure I hire
    people I can trust 100%. Second, I always try to hire people who are smarter
    than I am. Third, I give them the independence to do as they see fit as long
    as they communicate about it to their other team members. We've had a lot of
    growing pains, a lot of issues; but we've been able to deal with them
    because we have a high level of trust, skill and communication."
</blockquote>
<p>
    I know for myself that when I (1) don't feel trusted, and/or (2) am not
    given independence to do what I see as necessary to do my job, I don't
    communicate with my superiors about my actions, and I also get lazy about my
    job because I don't feel my work is valued.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, I feel that in my current work situation, my employers followed
    the same principles as Rao, and I've felt more productive and appreciated
    than I've felt in any previous job.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been thinking about trying to standardize the PHP code we do at work.
    Rob and I follow similar styles, but there are some definite differences. It
    would make delving into eachother's code much easier if we both followed
    some basic, agreed upon, guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I've been thinking about is function declarations. I find that I'm
    often retooling a function to make it more general, and in doing so either
    need to decrease or increase the number of arguments to it. This, of course,
    breaks compatability.
</p>
<p>
    So I propose that we have all functions take two arguments: $data and $db.
    $data is a hash which can then be extract'd via PHP. To change the number of
    arguments, you can simply set defaults for arguments or return meaningful
    errors for missing arguments.
</p>
<p>
    Another thought going through my mind deals with the fact that we reuse many
    of our applications across our various sites, and also export some of them.
    I think we should try and code the applications as functional libraries or
    classes, and then place them somewhere in PHP's include path. We can then
    have a "demo" area that shows how to use the libraries/classes (i.e.,
    example scripts), and to utilize a given application, we need simply include
    it like: 'include 'apps/eventCalendar/calendar.inc';'. This gives us maximum
    portability, and also forces us to code concisely and document vigorously.
</p>
<p>
    I was also reading on php.general tonight, and noticed some questions about
    PHP standards. Several people contend that PEAR is becoming the de facto
    standard, as it's the de facto extension library. In addition, because it is
    becoming a standard, there's also a standard for documenting projects, and
    this is phpdocumenter. The relevant links are:

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    One thing I noticed today when using RCS is that it isn't terribly user
    friendly -- you need to checkout a file to make edits. Often, I make edits,
    and <em>then</em> want to commit my changes.
</p>
<p>
    So I wrote a wrapper script called <b>revise</b>. It makes a temporary copy
    of the file you've been editing, checks it out of RCS with locking, makes it
    writeable, moves the temporary copy to the permanent name, checks it in and
    unlocks it (which prompts for a log message), and then makes the file
    writeable for the user and group again. The script is outlined here:
</p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/bash
    FILE=$1
    cp $FILE $FILE.new
    co -l $FILE
    chmod u+w $FILE
    mv $FILE.new $FILE
    ci -u $FILE
    chmod ug+w $FILE
</pre>
<p>
    Being the ROX-Filer centric person I am, I also wrote a quick perl script
    called <b>rox-revise</b> that I can then put in my SendTo menu. It parses
    the file's path, changes to that directory, and then calls the <b>revise</b>
    script on the filename, from within a terminal. This script follows:
</p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;

    use vars qw/$path $file $TERMCMD $REVISE $ZENITY/;

    # Configurable variables
    $TERMCMD = "myTerm";    # What terminal command to use; must be xterm compliant
    $REVISE  = "revise";    # What command to use to revise (i.e. rcs ci) the file
    $ZENITY  = "zenity";    # The zenity or dialog or xdialog command to use

    # Grab the filename from the command line
    $path = shift;
    $file = $path;

    # If no file given, raise a dialog and quit
    if (!$path || ($path eq '')) {
        system(
            $ZENITY, 
            '--title=Error', 
            '--warning', 
            "--text=No path given to $0; rox-revise quit!"
        );
        exit 0;
    }

    # Get the path to the file and switch to that directory
    if ($path =~ m#/#) {
        $path =~ s#^(.*)/.*?$#$1#;
        if ($path !~ m#^/#) { $path = "./$path"; }
        chdir $path or die "$path not found!n";
    } else {
    # Or else assume we're in the current directory
        $path = './';
    }

    # Get the filename
    $file =~ s#^.*/(.*?)$#$1#;

    # Execute the revise statement
    my $failure = system($TERMCMD, '-e', $REVISE, $file);
    if ($failure) {
        # on failure, raise a dialog
        system(
            $ZENITY, 
            '--title=Error', 
            '--warning', 
            "--text=Unable to revise $file"
        );
    }

    1;
</pre>
<p>
    Now I just need to check out <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>, and I can have some
    robust versioning!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/10-SSH-tips-and-tricks.html">SSH tips and tricks</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In trying to implement some of the hacks in <em>Linux Server Hacks</em>, I
    had to go to the ssh manpage, where I discovered a number of cool tricks. 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>In order to get key-based authentication (i.e., passwordless) working,
    the <tt>$HOME/.ssh</tt> directory must be mode <tt>0700</tt>, and all files
    in it must be mode <tt>0600</tt>. Once that's setup properly, key-based
    authentication works perfectly.</li>
    <li>You can have a file called <em>config</em> in your <tt>$HOME/.ssh</tt>
    directory that specifies user-specific settings for using SSH, as well as a
    number of <em>host</em>-specific settings:
        <ul>
            <li><tt>Compression yes</tt> turns
            on compression</li>
            <li><tt>ForwardX11 yes</tt> turns
            on X11 forwarding by default</li>
            <li><tt>ForwardAgent yes</tt> turns
            on ssh-agent forwarding by default</li>
            <li><em>Host</em>-based settings go from one <em>Host</em> keyword
            to the next, so place them at the end of the file. Do it in the
            following order:
            <pre>
    Host nickname
    HostName actual.host.name
    User username_on_that_host
    Port PortToUse
            </pre>
            This means, for instance, that I can ssh back and forth between
            home using the same key-based authentication and the same ssh-to
            script (<a href="#ssh-to">more below</a>) I use for work servers --
            because I don't have to specify the port or the username.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><a name="ssh-to">
    I mentioned a script called <tt>ssh-to</tt>
    earlier. This is a neat little hack from the server hacks book as well.
    Basically, you have the following script in your path somewhere:
</a></p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/bash
    ssh -C `basename $0` $*
</a></pre>
<p>
    Then, elsewhere in your path, you do a bunch of <tt>ln -s /path/to/ssh-to
    /path/to/$HOSTNAME</tt>, where <tt>$HOSTNAME</tt> is the name of a host to
    which you ssh regularly; this is where specifying a host nickname in your
    <tt>$HOME/.ssh/config</tt> file can come in
    handy. Then, to ssh to any such server, you simply type <tt>$HOSTNAME</tt>
    at the command line, and you're there!
