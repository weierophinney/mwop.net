    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/113-Phly_Struct-no%2C-Phly_Hash....html">Phly_Struct? no, Phly_Hash...</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After some discussion with <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul</a>
    and <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike</a>, I was convinced that
    'Struct' was a bad name for Phly_Struct; structs are rarely if ever
    iterable, and one key feature of Phly_Struct is its iterable nature.
</p>
<p>
    The question is: what to name it? Associative arrays go by a variety of
    names in different languages. In Perl, they're 'hashes'; Ruby and
    Javascript, 'collections'; Python, 'dictionaries'. I ruled out
    'Phly_Dictionary' immediately, as (a) I don't want it to be confused with
    online dictionaries, and (b), it's too long. The term 'Collection' also
    feels too long (although I write things like
    'Cgiapp2_ErrorException_Observer_Interface', so I don't know why length
    should be such an issue), as well as unfamiliar to many PHP developers. Hash
    can imply cryptographic algorithms, but, overall, is short and used often
    enough in PHP circles that it makes sense to me.
</p>
<p>
    So, I've renamed Phly_Struct to <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/index.php?package=Phly_Hash">Phly_Hash</a>,
    and updated Phly_Config to use the new package as its dependency. In
    addition, I've had it implement Countable, so you can do things like:
</p>
<div class="example"><pre><code lang="php">
$idxCount = count($struct);
</code></pre></div>
<p>
    Go to the <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/">channel page</a> for
    instructions on adding Phly to your PEAR channels list, and grab the new
    package with <tt>pear install -a phly/Phly_Hash</tt>, or <tt>pear upgrade -a
    phly/Phly_Config</tt>.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I often find myself needing a configuration module of some sort -- for
    storing application parameters, bootstrapping, template variables, what have
    you. I typically will either:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a PHP file that creates and returns an array, and suck that in
    via <a href="http://www.php.net/include">include</a>, or</li>
    <li>Create an INI file and suck it in via 
    <a href="http://www.php.net/parse_ini_file">parse_ini_file</a>, or</li>
    <li>Create an XML file and suck it in via 
    <a href="http://www.php.net/simplexml">SimpleXML</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The first method gives great flexibility of structure and types, but isn't
    portable to other languages (well, not easily; you could turn it into JSON,
    or serialize it, etc).  The second method (INI files) is handy because the
    syntax is so concise, and can translate to other projects in other languages
    easily if necessary; however, you can only easily go two levels deep (using
    [sections] in the file). The third method is very portable, and allows
    nested structures -- but doesn't allow usage of many specific PHP types.
</p>
<p>
    I find, however, that each has their place. The problem, however, is: once I
    bring them into my project, how can I access them? Better yet, would there
    be a way to bring in configurations of many types and still access them all
    in the same way?
</p>
<p>
    Not happy with solutions out there, I did the only logical thing: I
    reinvented the wheel, and added some new tread of my own.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/111-mbstring-comes-to-the-rescue.html">mbstring comes to the rescue</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been working with SimpleXML a fair amount lately, and have run into an
    issue a number of times with character encodings. Basically, if a string 
    has a mixture of UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 characters, SimpleXML barfs, claiming
    the "String could not be parsed as XML."
</p>
<p>
    I tried a number of solutions, hoping actually to automate it via mbstring
    INI settings; these schemes all failed. iconv didn't work properly. 
    The only thing that did work was to convert the encoding to latin1 -- but
    this wreaked havoc with actual UTF-8 characters.
</p>
<p>
    Then, through a series of trial-and-error, all-or-nothing shots, I stumbled
    on a simple solution. Basically, I needed to take two steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Detect the current encoding of the string</li>
    <li>Convert that encoding to UTF-8</li>
</ul>
<p>which is accomplished with:</p>
<div class="example"><pre><code lang="php">
$enc = mb_detect_encoding($xml);
$xml = mb_convert_encoding($xml, 'UTF-8', $enc);
</code></pre></div>
<p>
    The conversion is performed even if the detected encoding is UTF-8; the
    conversion ensures that <em>all</em> characters in the string are properly
    encoded when done.
</p>
<p>
    It's a non-intuitive solution, but it works! QED.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been working on <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp</a> in
    the past few months, in particular to introduce one possibility for a Front
    Controller class. To test out ideas, I've decided to port areas of my
    personal site to Cgiapp2 using the Front Controller. Being the 
    programmer I am, I quickly ran into some areas where I needed some reusable
    code -- principally for authentication and input handling.
</p>
<p>
    I've been exposed to a ton of good code via <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.solarphp.com/">Solar</a>, 
    <a href="http://ez.no/products/ez_components">eZ components</a>, and 
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>. However, I have
    several criteria I need met:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I want PHP5 code. I'm coding in PHP5, I should be able to use PHP5
    libraries, not PHP4 libraries that work in PHP5 but don't take advantage of
    any of its features.</li>
    <li>I prefer few dependencies, particularly lock-in with existing
    frameworks. If I want to swap out a storage container from one library and
    use one from another, I should be free to do so without having to write
    wrappers so they'll fit with the framework I've chosen. Flexibility is
    key.</li>
    <li>Stable API. I don't want to have to change my code every few weeks or
    months until the code is stable.</li>
    <li>I should be able to understand the internals quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    So what did I choose? To reinvent the wheel, of course!
</p>
<p>
    To that end, I've opened a new PEAR channel that I'm calling 
    <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/">PHLY, the PHp LibrarY</a>, named
    after my blog. The name implies soaring, freedom, and perhaps a little
    silliness.
</p>
<p>
    It is designed with the following intentions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loosely coupled; dependencies should be few, and no base class should be necessary.</li>
    <li>Extendible; all classes should be easily extendible. This may be via observers, interfaces, adapters, etc.. The base class should solve 80% of usage, and allow extensions to the class to fill in the remainder.</li>
    <li>Designed for PHP5 and up; all classes should make use of PHP5's features.</li>
    <li>Documented; all classes should minimally have excellent API-level documentation, with use cases in the class docblock.</li>
    <li>Tested; all classes should have unit tests accompanying them.</li>
    <li>Open source and commercial friendly; all classes should use a commercial-friendly open source license. The BSD license is one such example.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please feel free to use this code however you will. Comments, feedback, and
    submissions are always welcome.

    I released Cgiapp 1.9.0 into the wild last night. The main difference
    between 1.8.0 and 1.9.0 is that I completely removed the plugin system. I
    hadn't had any users reporting that they were using it, and, in point of
    fact, the overloading mechanism I was using was causing some obscure issues,
    particularly in the behaviour of cgiapp_postrun().

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After some conversations with <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/">Paul</a>
    and <a href="http://naberezny.com/">Mike</a>, in recent months I realized
    that while I often announce new releases of 
    <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp</a>, I rarely explain what
    it is or why I develop it.
</p>
<p>
    <strike>I got into trouble on the <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>
    list when I tried to propose it for inclusion in that project, when I made
    the mistake of describing it as a framework. (This was before frameworks
    became all the rage on the PHP scene; PEAR developers, evidently, will not
    review anything that could possibly be construed or interpreted as a
    framework, even if it isn't.)</strike> I mistakenly called Cgiapp a
    framework once when considering proposing it to PEAR. But if it's not a
    framework, what is Cgiapp? Stated simply:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Cgiapp is the Controller of a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It can be
    either a front controller or an application controller, though it's
    typically used as the latter.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/107-Telcos-are-Attacking-the-Internet.html">Telcos are Attacking the Internet</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I generally try to stay out of politics on this blog, but this time
    something has to be said, as it affects anyone who uses the internet, at
    least in the US.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, a number of telcos and cable providers are talking about charging
    internet content providers -- the places you browse to on the internet,
    places like Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, etc. -- fees to ensure bandwidth to
    their sites. Their argument is that these content providers are getting a
    'free ride' on their lines, and generating a lot of traffic themselves, and
    should thus be paying for the cost of bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
    This is patently ridiculous. Content providers already have to pay for their
    bandwidth -- they, too, have ISPs or agreements with telcos in place, either
    explicitly or via their hosting providers. Sure, some of them, particularly
    search engines, send out robots in order to index or find content, but,
    again, they're paying for the bandwidth those robots generate.
    Additionally, people using the internet are typically paying for bandwidth
    as well, through their relationship with their ISP. What this amounts to is
    the telcos getting paid not just by each person to whom they provide
    internet access, but every end point on the internet, at least those within
    the US.
</p>
<p>
    What this is really about is telcos wanting more money, and wanting to push
    their own content. As an example, let's say your ISP is AOL. AOL is part of
    Time Warner, and thus has ties to those media sources. Now, those media
    sources may put pressure on AOL to reduce bandwidth to sites operated by
    ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, Disney, PBS, etc. This might mean that your kid can no
    longer visit the Sesame Street website reliably, because AOL has reduced the
    amount of bandwidth allowed to that service -- but any media site in the TWC
    would get optimal access, so they could get to Cartoon Network. Not to slam
    Cartoon Network (I love it), but would you rather have your kid visiting
    cartoonnetwork.com or pbskids.org?  Basically, content providers would not
    need to compete based on the value of their content, but on who they can get
    to subscribe to their service.
</p>
<p>
    Here's another idea: your ISP is MSN. You want to use Google... but MSN has
    limited the bandwidth to Google because it's a competitor, and won't accept
    any amount of money to increase that bandwidth. They do the same with Yahoo!
    So, now you're limited to MSN search, because that's the only one that
    responds reliably -- regardless of whether or not you like their search
    results. By doing so, they've just artificially inflated the value of their
    search engine -- without needing to compete based on merit. 
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, let's say Barnes and Noble has paid MSN to ensure good
    bandwidth, but part of that agreement is a non-compete clause.  Now you find
    your connections to Amazon timing out, meaning that you can't even see which
    book provider has the better price on the book you want; you're stuck
    looking and buying from B&amp;N.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's look at something a little more close to home for those of us
    developing web applications. There have been a number of success stories the
    last few years: MySpace, Digg, and Flickr all come to mind. Would these
    endeavors have been as successful had they needed to pay multiple times for
    bandwidth, once to their ISP and once each to each telco charging for
    content providers? Indeed, some of these are still free services -- how
    would they ever have been able to pay the extra amounts to the telcos in the
    first place?
</p>
<p>
    So, basically, the only winners here are the telcos.
</p>
<p>
    Considering how ludicrous this scheme is, one must be thinking, isn't the US
    Government going to step in and regulate against such behaviour? <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2006/tc20060426_553893.htm?chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today">The answer, sadly, is no.</a>
    The GOP doesn't like regulation, and so they want market forces to decide.
    Sadly, what this will likely do is force a number of content providers to
    offshore their internet operations -- which is likely to have some pretty
    negative effects on the economy.
</p>
<p>
    The decision isn't final -- efforts can still be made to prevent it (the
    above link references a Senate committee meeting; there's been no vote on
    it). Call your representatives today and give them an earful. Tell them it's
    not just about regulation of the industry, but about fair competition in the
    market. Allowing the telcos to extort money from content providers will only
    reduce the US' economic chances in the world, and stifle innovation and
    choice.

        <li>In you php.ini file, set "display_errors = On", <b>or</b></li>
        <li>In your script, add the line "ini_set('display_errors', true);"</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>To show notices, warnings, errors, deprecation
        notices:</strong><ul>
        <li>In you php.ini file, set "error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT", <b>or</b></li>
        <li>In your script, add the line "error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT);"</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can create a file with the lines:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
    error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT);
    ini_set('display_errors', true);
</pre>
<p>
    and then set the php.ini setting 'auto_prepend_file' to the path to that
    file.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NOTE: do not do any of the above on a production system!</strong>
    PHP's error messages often reveal a lot about your applications, including
    file layout and potential vectors of attack. Turn display_errors off on
    production machines, set your error_reporting somewhat lower, and log_errors
    to a file so you can keep track of what's going on on your production
    system.
</p>
<p>
    The second part of the question was how to run a PHP script on the command
    line. This is incredibly simple: php myscript.php. No different than any
    other scripting language.
</p>
<p>
    You can get some good information by using some of the switches, though.
    <strong>'-l'</strong> turns the PHP interpreter into a linter, and can let
    you know if your code is well-formed (which doesn't necessarily preclude
    runtime or parse errors). <strong>'-f'</strong> will run the script through
    the parser, which can give you even more information. I typically bind these
    actions to keys in vim so I can check my work as I go.
</p>
<p>
    If you plan on running your code <em>solely</em> on the commandline, add a
    shebang to the first line of your script: #!/path/to/php. Then make the
    script executable, and you're good to go. This is handy for cronjobs, or
    batch processing scripts.
</p>
<p>
    All of this information is readily available in <a
        href="http://www.php.net/manual">the PHP manual</a>, and the commandline
    options are always available by passing the --help switch to the PHP
    executable. So, start testing your scripts already!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/104-Cgiapp-dual-releases.html">Cgiapp dual releases</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Today, I have released two versions of Cgiapp into the wild, Cgiapp 1.8.0
    and Cgiapp2 2.0.0rc1.
</p>
<p>
    Cgiapp 1.8.0 is a performance release. I did a complete code audit of the
    class, and did a number of changes to improve performance and fix some
    previously erratic behaviours. Additionally, I tested under both PHP4 and
    PHP5 to make sure that behaviour is the same in both environments.
</p>
<p>
    However, Cgiapp 1.8.0 markes the last feature release of Cgiapp. I am
    deprecating the branch in favor of Cgiapp2.
</p>
<p>
    Cgiapp2 is a PHP5-only version of Cgiapp. Some of the changes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cgiapp2 is an abstract class, with the abstract method setup(). Now it
    is truly non-instantiable!</li>
    <li>Cgiapp2 makes extensive use of visibility operators. Key methods have
    been marked final, some methods are now protected, others static. See <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/index.php/view/Changelog2">the changelog</a> for more information.</li>
    <li>Cgiapp2 is now E_STRICT compliant.</li>
    <li>Cgiapp2 implements the CGI::Application 4.x series callback hook system.
    This is basically an observer pattern, allowing developers to register
    callbacks that execute at different locations in the runtime.</li>
    <li>Cgiapp2 adds some extensive error and exception handling classes,
    including observable errors and exceptions.</li>
    <li>I created a template interface. If implemented, a template engine can be
    plugged into the architecture at will -- at the superclass, application
    class, and instance script level, allowing developers to mix-and-match
    template engines or choose whichever matches their taste, <em>without</em>
    having to rewrite application code. Three template plugins are included:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://phpsavant.com/yawiki/">Savant2</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://phpsavant.com/yawiki/index.php?area=Savant3&page=HomePage">Savant3</a></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=125419&package_id=137071">Cgiapp</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=125419&package_id=180286">Cgiapp2</a> are available at
    Sourceforge.
<p>
    Keep reading for more information on the evolution of Cgiapp2.
