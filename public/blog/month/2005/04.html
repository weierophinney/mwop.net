    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Cgiapp 1.6.0, "Wart Removal", has been released!
</p>
<p>
    This release does not add any new methods, but adds quite a lot in terms of
    functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>phpt tests.</b> I finished writing a suite of unit tests using the
    phpt framework popularized by the PHP-QA project and PEAR. This process
    helped me find some obscure bugs in the class, as well as some... well,
    downright ugly code, and to fix these areas. (To be honest, most of the
    'ugly' code was a result of being too literal when porting from perl and not
    using more standard PHP functionality.) Among the bugs fixed:
        <ul>
            <li>s_delete() now works properly.</li>
            <li>param() and s_param() now behave gracefully when given bad data
            (as do a number of other methods)</li>
            <li>_send_headers() and the header_*() suite now function as
            documented.</li>
            <li>All methods now react gracefully to bad input.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Error handling.</b> carp() and croak() no longer echo directly to the
    output stream (and, in the case of croak(), die); they use trigger_error().
    This will allow developers to use carp() and croak() as part of their
    regular arsenal of PHP errors -- including allowing PHP error handling.
    Additionally, most croak() calls in the class were changed to carp() as they
    were not truly fatal errors.</li>
    <li><b>PEAR packaging.</b> Cgiapp can now be installed using PEAR's
    installer. Simply download the package and type 'pear install
    Cgiapp-1.6.0.tgz' to get Cgiapp installed sitewide on your system!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As usual, Cgiapp is available at <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">the Cgiapp website</a>.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    As promised in my earlier entry from today, here's my quick-and-dirty
    tutorial on unit testing in PHP using phpt.
</p>
<p>
    First off, phpt test files, from what I can see, were created as part of the
    <a href="http://qa.php.net/">PHP-QA</a> effort. While I cannot find a link
    within the PHP-QA site, they <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">have
        a page detailing phpt test files</a>, and this page shows all the
    sections of a phpt test file, though they do not necessarily show examples
    of each.
</p>
<p>
    Also, you might find <a
        href="http://www.phpmag.net/itr/kolumnen/psecom,id,26,nodeid,207.html">this
        International PHP Magazine article</a> informative; in it <a
        href="http://www.wormus.com/aaron">Aaron Wormus</a> gives a brief
    tutorial on them, as well as some ways to use phpt tests with PHPUnit.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, before I jump in, I want to note: I am not an expert on unit
    testing. However, the idea behind unit tests is straightforward: keep your
    code simple and modular, and test each little bit (or module) for all types
    of input and output. If the code you're testing is a function or class
    method, test all permutations of arguments that could be passed to it, and
    all possible return values.
</p>
<p>
    Okay, let's jump in!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/64-PHP-Unit-Tests-and-the-winner-is-phpt.html">PHP Unit Tests: and the winner is: phpt</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been tinkering with <a
    href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">Unit
    Testing</a> for around a year now, and have tried using <a
    href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHPUnit">PHP Unit</a> as well as <a
    href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">Simple Test</a>. It was
    while following the Simple Test tutorial that I finally grokked the idea of
    unit testing, and so that has been my favored class for testing.
</p>
<p>
    However, I find writing the tests tedious. In Simple Test, as in PHP Unit,
    you need to create a class that sets up the testing harness, and then you
    create a method for each test you wish to run, and so on... I found it
    incredibly time consuming. Additionally, I found the test harness often felt
    like a foreign way of testing my code; I was setting up a structure I would
    never use my code in, typically. All in all, I only test when I have extra
    time (which is rare) or when I'm really having trouble nailing down bugs
    (and the unit tests often don't help me find them).
</p>
<p>
    Recently, I've been hearing some buzz over on the <a
        href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR</a> lists and the blogs of some of its
    developers about 'phpt' tests. From what I hear, phpt tests sound very
    similar to how one tests in perl (though I've never written perl tests, I've
    at least glanced through them). However, until recently, I haven't seen any
    documentation on them, and installing PEAR packages via pear doesn't install
    tests.
</p>
<p>
    We got a copy of <a href="http://php5powerprogramming.com/">PHP5 Power
        Programming</a> a few weeks ago, and in the section on preparing a PEAR
    package was a brief section on phpt tests. The section was small, and when I
    looked at it, my immediate thought was, "it can't be <em>that</em> simple,
    can it?"
</p>
<p>
    So, I decided to try it out with <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp</a>. A few minutes later, I
    had some working tests for my static methods. "Hmmm," I thought, "That was
    easy. Let's try some more." 
</p>
<p>
    Turns out they're kind of addictive to geeks like me. In a matter of a few
    hours, I'd knocked out tests for over half the functionality, and
    disccovered, to my chagrine and joy, a number of bugs and bad coding
    practices... which I promptly corrected so I could get that magical 'PASS'
    from the test harness.
</p>
<p>
    In the process of writing the tests, my understanding of the tool evolved
    quite a bit, and by the end, I had the knack for it down. I'll blog later
    about some of the ways I made them easier to use for myself -- and how I
    made them more useful for debugging purposes.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/63-Abstract-Classes.html">Abstract Classes</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just had to add a note over on PHP.net regarding abstract classes and
    methods: 
    <a href="http://php.net/language.oop5.abstract">Object Abstraction</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm working on Cgiapp2, which is a PHP5-only implementation of Cgiapp that
    is built to utilize PHP5's new object model as well as exceptions. One thing
    I decided to do, initially, was to make it an abstract class, and to mark
    the overridable methods as abstract as well.
</p>
<p>
    In testing, I started getting some strange errors. Basically, it was saying
    in my class extension that an abstract method existed, and thus the class
    should be marked as abstract, and, finally, that this means it wouldn't run.
</p>
<p>
    What was so odd is that the method didn't exist in the extension at all.
</p>
<p>
    So, I overrode the method in the extension... and voila! Everything worked
    fine.
</p>
<p>
    The lesson to take away from this is quite simple: if the method does not
    need to be present in the overriding class, don't mark it as abstract. Only
    mark a method as abstract if:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The method is required in the class implementation, and</li>
    <li>The extending class should be responsible for implementing said
    method</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now I need to update my source tree.... :-(

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    At work this week, Rob was doing some monitoring of our bandwidth usage. We
    have SNMP on each of our servers now, and he uses MRTG to create bandwidth
    usage graphs that are updated every five minutes or so. He's been monitoring
    since late last year.
</p>
<p>
    Before January, we had two systems going. The first, legacy, system hosted
    the majority of the content from garden.org, and was done using Tango 2000,
    a web application server that ran on top of IIS and Windows NT 4. I say
    'ran', because Tango 2000 was the last version to ship; the company that
    made it stopped supporting it a year later. This meant we could not upgrade
    our server's OS to Windows 2000 or 2003, nor could we switch to a more
    secure web server, etc. It was a time bomb waiting to happen.
</p>
<p>
    The second system is a basic LAMP system -- Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP.
    Rob began migrating applications to it shortly after he started at NGA 3
    years ago, one application at a time. Mostly, new applications were placed
    on it, though in May 2003, he and the other programmer who was there at the
    time started migrating old applications to the techology. Part of the reason
    I was hired was to continue this migration.
</p>
<p>
    The migration was time consuming, and plenty of other projects often got in
    the way. However, starting last July, we made a big push to get it all
    ported over -- before the old WinNT server fails on us. In January, we were
    able to rollout the new garden.org, which runs on this new technology.
</p>
<p>
    A big reason we were able to finish is because of Cgiapp. I originally
    ported it to PHP last year around this time, and knew that while I wanted to
    develop new applications using it, I wasn't so sure I could sell Rob on it.
</p>
<p>
    Amazingly, it didn't take much to convince him. We had already started using
    Smarty for templates just before this, and were also using OOP in new
    development. Cgiapp just helped unify these technologies and to provide a
    nice, standard framework with which to program.
</p>
<p>
    This last can not be emphasized enough. We started developing all
    applications in three places: an API for data access, a Cgiapp-based
    application, and our templates. Either one of us could pick up development
    of an application from the other without having to spend a day or two
    familiarizing ourselves with the idiosyncracies of what the other had
    decided was the programming paradigm of the day. Sure, we still have our own
    programming styles, but the framework makes it easy to debug or extend each
    others programs painlessly.
</p>
<p>
    Now, back to the bandwidth reports: Rob has noticed that our bandwidth usage
    has been growing steadily on the new server since we switched garden.org
    over -- a 45 degree line. At one point this week, our outgoing bandwidth was
    almost 3 T1s -- and we were having no performance issues whatsoever. This
    simply would not have been possible on the old system -- nor without Cgiapp.
    We've managed to produce both a hardware architecture and a programming
    framework that has proved immensely scalable -- which will in turn save the
    organization money.
</p>
<p>
    I love open source! How else can you create such high-performing software
    without paying through the nose for it?
