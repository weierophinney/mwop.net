    I've been working on Zend_XmlRpc_Server for some months now. In the past
    couple weeks, I've refactored it to push the class/function reflection into
    Zend_Server_Reflection, and, in doing so, noted that there were further
    areas for refactoring into additional helper classes. Currently, it now has
    classes for the Request, Response, and Faults, and all actual XML wrangling
    is done in those, making the server basically XML-agnostic.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    As <a href="http://pixelated-dreams.com/archives/251-More-Web-Services.html">Davey Shafik noted recently</a>,
    he and I have been working together on some web services for the 
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>. In doing so, I've
    become very familiar with PHP 5's Reflection API, and am coming to love it.
</p>
<p>
    When I first read about the Reflection API in a pre-PHP 5 changelog, my
    initial reaction was, "who cares?" I simply failed to see how it was a
    useful addition to the language. Having done some projects recently that
    needed to know something about the classes they are using, I now understand
    when and how it can be used. It shines when you need to work with classes
    that may not be defined when you write your code -- any code that dispatches
    to other classes, basically.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I may work at <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a>, but I've never been a
    fan of IDEs. They simply don't suit my programming style. I can usually keep
    track of file locations in my head pretty easily, and what I really need is
    a blank slate on which I can write, and one that doesn't consume resource
    that can better be used running web servers and other programs. Syntax
    highlighting, good indentation -- these are important, but you can get these
    from good, minimal text editors very easily. 
    <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim is my editor of choice</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I will admit, though, that one area where I have had IDE-envy is the area of
    code completion. I often find myself doing quick lookups to php.net or
    perldoc to determine the order of arguments to a function or method call,
    or checking for the expected return value. Most of the time, this doesn't
    take much time, however, so I just live with it.
</p>
<p>
    Today, however, cruising through the blogosphere, I came across 
    <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/09/visual-walk-through-of-couple-of-new.html">an article showcasing some new features of Vim 7.0</a>, 
    and discovered Vim 7's code completion.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, while in insert mode, you can type &lt;C-x&gt; &lt;C-o&gt; to
    have vim attempt to autocomplete the current keyword. If more than one
    possibility exists, it shows a dropdown, and you can use your arrow keys to
    highlight the keyword that you wish to use.
</p>
<p>
    But it gets better! Not only does it do this kind of autocompletion, but it
    also opens a small 'scratch preview' pane showing the function/method
    signature -- i.e., the expected arguments and return value!
</p>
<p>
    I thought I had little need for IDEs before... now I have even less! Bram
    and the rest of the Vim team, my hat's off to you for more fine work!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In response to <a href="http://fuzzyblog.com/archives/2006/06/22/php-advice-requested-variable-functions-versus-call_user_func-and-call_user_func_array/">Scott Johnson's request for advice on variable functions</a>,
    I decided to run some benchmarks.
</p>
<p>
    &lt;rant&gt;Writing benchmarks is easy. Yet I see a lot of blog entries and
    mailing list postings asking, "Which is faster?" My first thought is always,
    "Why didn't they test and find out?" If I ever have a question about how
    something will work, I open up a temporary file, start coding, and run the
    code. It's the easiest way to learn. Also, it teaches you to break things
    into manageable, testable chunks, and this code often forms the basis for a
    unit test later.&lt;/rant&gt;
</p>
<p>
    Back to benchmarking. Scott asks, "Is there a real difference between
    call_user_func versus call_user_func_array and the variable function syntax
    i.e. $function_name()?"
</p>
<p>
    The short answer: absolutely. The long answer? Read on.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/120-Serendipity-upgrade.html">Serendipity upgrade</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I upgraded <a href="http://www.s9y.org/">Serendipity</a> today, due to the
    recent announcement of the 1.0 release, as well as to combat some rampant
    issues with trackback spam.
</p>
<p>
    I've been very happy with Serendipity so far; it just runs, and the default
    install gives just what you need to get a blog up and running, and nothing
    more; any extra functionality comes via plugins which you, the blogger, get
    to decide upon.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, it's incredibly easy to upgrade. Unpack the tarball, rsync
    it over your existing install (I rsync it, because I don't use 'serendipity'
    as my directory name), visit the admin, boom, you're done. I've upgraded
    several times, and never lost data, nor configuration settings. 
</p>
<p>
    My primary reason for the upgrade was, as noted earlier, to combat trackback
    spam. As of this morning, I had 15,000 pending trackbacks, none of which
    appeared to be valid (if any of them were, and you're not seeing yours, I'm
    very sorry; I deleted them <em>en masse</em>). These had accumulated in <em>less than
    a month</em> -- that's an average of about one every 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    Since upgrading, and using the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>
    service, I've received not a single spam trackback. Needless to say, I'm
    happy I performed the upgrade!
</p>
<p>
    If you're a Serendipity user, and haven't upgraded to 1.0.0 yet (or one of
    it's reportedly very stable release candidates), do it today -- you have
    nothing to lose, and a lot of lost time to gain!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I ran across a blog post entitled "<a href="http://blog.develix.com/frog/user/cliff/article/2006-06-04/9">Why the Light Has Gone Out on LAMP</a>" 
    earlier today, and felt compelled to respond.
</p>
<p>
    First, a rant: somehow, this article got posted on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>. 
    I've never heard of the guy who posted it, and some quick googling shows
    that he's a pythoner. He's simply fueling the language wars, and the
    slashdot post opened up a huge debate that need not have occurred. I think
    it was irresponsible of the Slashdot editors to post it.
</p>
<p>
    In the post, the author makes an analogy of using PHP + MySQL as the
    equivalent of using BASIC, and then uses a quote that claims BASIC "has
    become the leading cause of brain-damage in proto-hackers." 
</p>
<p>
    I'm sorry, but using a language doesn't cause brain damage. And there are
    many levels to programming. And using Python, Ruby, C, C++, Java, etc., does
    not automatically make you a better programmer than those using one of
    "those other languages". You can write crap code in any language. You can
    also write great code in just about any language.
</p>
<p>
    Programming takes practice; programming well takes a lot of practice. You
    get better at it by learning more about programming practices, and applying
    them to your language. Part of programming is also learning when a
    particular language is suited to a task, and when it isn't. Python works for
    the web, but it's not particularly suited to it; similarly, you can write
    web servers in PHP, but that doesn't mean you should.
</p>
<p>
    Stop the language wars already! Stop writing incendiary pieces about a
    language you don't use regularly or never gained particular proficiency in,
    and code already!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    A <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/darcs/">darcs repository browser</a> is now online for the
    <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/">Phly channel</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you're not familiar with <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/">darcs</a>, 
    it's a revision control system, similar to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">GNU Arch</a>
    and <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>; changes are kept as patch sets, and
    repositories are branched simply by checking them out. This makes darcs
    repositories very flexible, and incredibly easy to implement. Static
    binaries are available for most systems, which makes it easy to install on
    systems to which you have no administrator rights.
</p>
<p>
    A perl CGI script is shipped with darcs, and provides a web-based repository
    viewer. It utilizes darcs' <code>--xml-output</code> switch to create XML, which is
    then transformed using XSLT. However, there are some issues with the script;
    it is somewhat difficult to customize, and makes many assumptions about your
    system (location of configuration files, repositories, etc.). To make it
    more flexible, I ported it to PHP, using <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/index.php?package=Cgiapp2">Cgiapp2</a>
    and its XSLT template plugin and <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/index.php?package=Phly_Config">Phly_Config</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I have released this PHP darcs repository browser as <a href="http://weierophinney.net/phly/index.php?package=Phly_Darcs">Phly_Darcs</a>, 
    which contains both a Model and Controller, as well as example XSLT view
    templates. It is currently in beta as I'm still developing PHPUnit2 tests
    for some of the model functionality, as well as debating the ability to add
    write capabilities (to authenticated users only, of course).
