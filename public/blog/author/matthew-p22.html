    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/72-phpTropics-recap.html">php|Tropics recap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    <a href="http://www.phparch.com/tropics">php|Tropics</a> last week was
    excellent, and I'm not even sure where to begin for a recap. I started
    journaling while there, but found I simply did not have enough time (or
    bandwidth -- my one complaint about the conference) to keep up.
</p>
<p>
    The trip down was hellish. I'd lost my birth certificate, and was turned
    away at the ticket counter due to improper documentation. I was able to
    reschedule for several hours later, and had <em>just</em> enough time to go
    home, look futilely for my birth certificate, and then run down to the town
    clerk office in Bolton to get a certified and notarized letter proving my
    voter registration. Which got me on the plane, but I still ended up having
    to sign a notarized affidavit of citizenship before my final flight from
    Houston could take off.
</p>
<p>
    The resort where the conference was held is called Moon Palace Resort, and
    is one of a string of five or more 'Palace' resorts on the Mexican Riviera
    below Cancun. The place is huge -- there are two lobby areas, and each
    serves what looks like a couple thousand rooms. You can't help but get
    exercise while there, because there's simply so much ground to cover.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/">Marco Tabini</a> gave the keynote,
    and kept it short and sweet. To my mind, he covered one primary point: the
    PHP job market sucks for pay. As he put it, why does an assembly line worker
    at Ford get paid $35/hour, while the average PHP developer is paid $15/hour?
    This is not to belittle the assembly line worker, but more to ask the
    question of whether or not a PHP developer is inherently less skilled. Marco
    feels that the way to boost PHP wages is to produce a standard educational
    corpus and licensing program -- and educate employers as to why someone who
    has taken them deserves to be paid more. (I'm still not sure how I feel
    about his conclusions, but they're certainly food for thought -- as I'm not
    being paid much more than the PHP average.)
</p>
<p>
    Rob and I skipped out on the first two sessions. To our mind, we weren't
    as interested in them as other sessions, and we weren't going to have much
    free time while there. We put on the swim trunks and took a stroll through
    the pool. Yes, a stroll. I wish I could find a map that shows just how long
    and serpentine the pool there is; you can easily get a good workout just
    going for a stroll in the pool.
</p>
<p>
    And strolling is thirsty business, so we strolled over to a swim-up bar.
    Now, one excellent thing about the location is that the resort is an
    "all-inclusive" resort -- meaning that all food <em>and</em> drink is
    included in the price. So, we ordered margaritas, since it was noon where we
    live. They were okay, a little weak... and Rob noted that the bartender
    wasn't using anything off the top shelf. "What do you think we need to do to
    get him to use the Sauza?" asked Rob, to which I replied, "I think you just
    ask for it." So, next round, "Margaritas con Sauza, por favor."
</p>
<p>
    And so it goes.
</p>
<p>
    Strolling also included the beach, a wonderful expanse of white sand
    overlooking the azure water of the Caribbean. I spent a lot of time just
    sitting under coconut trees staring out over the sea; I can see how tempting
    it would be to retire on the Caribbean.
</p>
<p>
    We started attending sessions that afternoon, and only missed one more over
    the course of the conference. I did get some excellent information from a
    number of sessions -- but one thing in particular I got out of the
    conference as a whole is how far advanced is the setup Rob and I have put
    together at NGA. Our web cluster is almost as good as it gets without
    pouring money into commercial databases and support (though <a
        href="http://ilia.ws/">Ilia Alshanetsky's</a> web acceleration session
    gave me a ton of information on tuning the relations between php, apache,
    and the OS); we've standardized on PEAR and are using it well; we're
    filtering data reasonably well (though we can always do better); etc. I
    often feel like I'm behind the curve when it comes to our technology, so the
    conference was a welcome boost to the ego.
</p>
<p>
    On day 2, I ran into <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog">Paul Jones</a>,
    with whom I've emailed once or twice, and on whose blog I've commented
    several times. We immediately started hanging out, and talking shop. Which
    began the other important aspect of the conference: the social networking.
</p>
<p>
    In day-to-day practice, I really only get to talk code and program with one
    other person, Rob. This is fine, but it leads to a narrow exposure. Going to
    the conference gave me a chance to go over code and coding philosophy with a
    larger variety of people -- my peer group, if you will. I got to see that,
    if you're not working for a large corporation, you do the same shit I do
    every day -- programming, installing and tuning servers, help desk issues,
    everything; coding in PHP is only one aspect of your busy life. It was
    actually refreshing to see that I'm not alone.
</p>
<p>
    A group of six of us got together that second evening, and ate out at one of
    the 'restaurants' (there are several eateries at the resort; not really
    restaurants, 'cause you don't have to pay, and they're all buffets)
    overlooking the Caribbean. As we were talking, we commented on how the
    networking amongst each other was probably the best part of the conference
    -- and how it would be nice if the speakers would deign to join us.
</p>
<p>
    Ask and ye shall receive. Later that evening, as we stood around the 'swing
    bar' (a little tiki bar with swings instead of bar stools, out on an island
    of the large, serpentine pool), we were gradually joined by speakers,
    including Marcus Boerger, <a href="http://netevil.org/">Wez Furlong</a>, <a
        href="http://www.derickrethans.nl/">Derick Rethans</a>, and
    <a href="http://blog.backendmedia.com/">Lukas Smith</a>. We had some great
    discussions that started devolving in indirect proportion to the amount we
    drank (well, not really devolving, but certainly migrating to other
    non-coding topics...)
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, Rob and I had to cut out around 11:30, as we were taking the
    <a
        href="http://www.zend.com/store/education/certification/zend-php-certification.php">Zend
    Certification Exam</a> at 8 the following morning. I quit drinking between
    9:30 and 10... Rob had not, so he got to do the exam with a hangover. All in
    all, I found the exam less difficult than the study guide, but certainly
    full of tricks meant to foil you.
</p>
<p>
    The final evening had a similar conclusion to the night before, only with
    even more participants, including <a
        href="http://blog.casey-sweat.us/">Jason Sweat</a> and Ilia. This time
    there were no exams to follow, and we stayed up until 1:30 (and later for
    some people). 
</p>
<p>
    Looking back, I see I wrote very little about the actual conference -- which
    seems odd, as it was the central event. There were certainly some excellent
    presentations, and a lot of great material -- much of it I have not been
    able to find elsewhere. Hopefully I'll find some time to blog about it in
    the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't take many pictures, and I need to get a gallery going anyways. Rob,
    however, took a ton of pictures and put them up on his site each day. You
    can view them at <a href="http://riggen.org/gallery/">his gallery</a>; I'll
    put direct links to the individual galleries later.
</p>
<p>
    So, if you get a chance, attend the next PHP conference you can possibly
    afford, and spend as much time as possible getting to know your fellow PHP
    code monkeys; the benefits are, to use an oft-used marketing phrase,
    priceless.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been wanting to play with <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_QuickForm">HTML_QuickForm</a> for
    quite some time, but the documentation has looked rather sparse and scary
    regarding the use of HTML_QuickForm with <a
        href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a>. Since I've been busy at work,
    and I haven't wanted to take the time to learn a new library, I've simply
    been putting it off.
</p>
<p>
    Last night, I browsed through the package documentation, and noticed a link
    to an <a
    href="http://www.thelinuxconsultancy.co.uk/quickform.php">HTML_QuickForm
    Getting Started Guide</a> by Keith Edmunds. I was pleased to discover that
    he also has a <a
    href="http://www.thelinuxconsultancy.co.uk/smarty-guide.php">guide to
    using Smarty with HTML_QuickForm</a>. I got started with these tutorials,
    and found them excellent. I found myself wanting a little more meat
    afterwards, and found that I could now turn to the PEAR docs and actually
    make sense of it all.
</p>
<p>
    While I think Mr. Edmunds tutorials are great for starters, I found that
    there were a few pointers I could have used right off the bat. I present
    them here for you.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've made two releases of Cgiapp this week, 1.6.2 and 1.6.3. 
</p>
<p>
    1.6.2 was tested in a PHP 4.3.4 environment, and features several bugfixes
    that give PHP4 compatibility.  1.6.3 fixes a change in load_tmpl() that
    broke backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
    As usual, Cgiapp is available on <a

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Cgiapp 1.6.0, "Wart Removal", has been released!
</p>
<p>
    This release does not add any new methods, but adds quite a lot in terms of
    functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>phpt tests.</b> I finished writing a suite of unit tests using the
    phpt framework popularized by the PHP-QA project and PEAR. This process
    helped me find some obscure bugs in the class, as well as some... well,
    downright ugly code, and to fix these areas. (To be honest, most of the
    'ugly' code was a result of being too literal when porting from perl and not
    using more standard PHP functionality.) Among the bugs fixed:
        <ul>
            <li>s_delete() now works properly.</li>
            <li>param() and s_param() now behave gracefully when given bad data
            (as do a number of other methods)</li>
            <li>_send_headers() and the header_*() suite now function as
            documented.</li>
            <li>All methods now react gracefully to bad input.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Error handling.</b> carp() and croak() no longer echo directly to the
    output stream (and, in the case of croak(), die); they use trigger_error().
    This will allow developers to use carp() and croak() as part of their
    regular arsenal of PHP errors -- including allowing PHP error handling.
    Additionally, most croak() calls in the class were changed to carp() as they
    were not truly fatal errors.</li>
    <li><b>PEAR packaging.</b> Cgiapp can now be installed using PEAR's
    installer. Simply download the package and type 'pear install
    Cgiapp-1.6.0.tgz' to get Cgiapp installed sitewide on your system!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As usual, Cgiapp is available at <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">the Cgiapp website</a>.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    As promised in my earlier entry from today, here's my quick-and-dirty
    tutorial on unit testing in PHP using phpt.
</p>
<p>
    First off, phpt test files, from what I can see, were created as part of the
    <a href="http://qa.php.net/">PHP-QA</a> effort. While I cannot find a link
    within the PHP-QA site, they <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">have
        a page detailing phpt test files</a>, and this page shows all the
    sections of a phpt test file, though they do not necessarily show examples
    of each.
</p>
<p>
    Also, you might find <a
        href="http://www.phpmag.net/itr/kolumnen/psecom,id,26,nodeid,207.html">this
        International PHP Magazine article</a> informative; in it <a
        href="http://www.wormus.com/aaron">Aaron Wormus</a> gives a brief
    tutorial on them, as well as some ways to use phpt tests with PHPUnit.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, before I jump in, I want to note: I am not an expert on unit
    testing. However, the idea behind unit tests is straightforward: keep your
    code simple and modular, and test each little bit (or module) for all types

    method, test all permutations of arguments that could be passed to it, and
    all possible return values.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been tinkering with <a
    href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">Unit
    Testing</a> for around a year now, and have tried using <a
    href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHPUnit">PHP Unit</a> as well as <a
    href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">Simple Test</a>. It was
    while following the Simple Test tutorial that I finally grokked the idea of
    unit testing, and so that has been my favored class for testing.
</p>
<p>
    However, I find writing the tests tedious. In Simple Test, as in PHP Unit,
    you need to create a class that sets up the testing harness, and then you
    create a method for each test you wish to run, and so on... I found it
    incredibly time consuming. Additionally, I found the test harness often felt
    like a foreign way of testing my code; I was setting up a structure I would
    never use my code in, typically. All in all, I only test when I have extra
    time (which is rare) or when I'm really having trouble nailing down bugs
    (and the unit tests often don't help me find them).
</p>
<p>
    Recently, I've been hearing some buzz over on the <a
        href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR</a> lists and the blogs of some of its
    developers about 'phpt' tests. From what I hear, phpt tests sound very
    similar to how one tests in perl (though I've never written perl tests, I've
    at least glanced through them). However, until recently, I haven't seen any
    documentation on them, and installing PEAR packages via pear doesn't install
    tests.
</p>
<p>
    We got a copy of <a href="http://php5powerprogramming.com/">PHP5 Power
        Programming</a> a few weeks ago, and in the section on preparing a PEAR
    package was a brief section on phpt tests. The section was small, and when I
    looked at it, my immediate thought was, "it can't be <em>that</em> simple,
    can it?"
</p>
<p>
    So, I decided to try it out with <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp</a>. A few minutes later, I
    had some working tests for my static methods. "Hmmm," I thought, "That was
    easy. Let's try some more." 
</p>
<p>
    Turns out they're kind of addictive to geeks like me. In a matter of a few
    hours, I'd knocked out tests for over half the functionality, and
    disccovered, to my chagrine and joy, a number of bugs and bad coding
    practices... which I promptly corrected so I could get that magical 'PASS'
    from the test harness.
</p>
<p>
    In the process of writing the tests, my understanding of the tool evolved
    quite a bit, and by the end, I had the knack for it down. I'll blog later
    about some of the ways I made them easier to use for myself -- and how I
    made them more useful for debugging purposes.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/63-Abstract-Classes.html">Abstract Classes</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just had to add a note over on PHP.net regarding abstract classes and
    methods: 
    <a href="http://php.net/language.oop5.abstract">Object Abstraction</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm working on Cgiapp2, which is a PHP5-only implementation of Cgiapp that
    is built to utilize PHP5's new object model as well as exceptions. One thing
    I decided to do, initially, was to make it an abstract class, and to mark
    the overridable methods as abstract as well.
</p>
<p>
    In testing, I started getting some strange errors. Basically, it was saying
    in my class extension that an abstract method existed, and thus the class
    should be marked as abstract, and, finally, that this means it wouldn't run.
</p>
<p>
    What was so odd is that the method didn't exist in the extension at all.
</p>
<p>
    So, I overrode the method in the extension... and voila! Everything worked
    fine.
</p>
<p>
    The lesson to take away from this is quite simple: if the method does not
    need to be present in the overriding class, don't mark it as abstract. Only
    mark a method as abstract if:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The method is required in the class implementation, and</li>
    <li>The extending class should be responsible for implementing said
    method</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now I need to update my source tree.... :-(
