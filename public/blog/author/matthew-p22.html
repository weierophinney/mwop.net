    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been wanting to play with <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_QuickForm">HTML_QuickForm</a> for
    quite some time, but the documentation has looked rather sparse and scary
    regarding the use of HTML_QuickForm with <a
        href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a>. Since I've been busy at work,
    and I haven't wanted to take the time to learn a new library, I've simply
    been putting it off.
</p>
<p>
    Last night, I browsed through the package documentation, and noticed a link
    to an <a
    href="http://www.thelinuxconsultancy.co.uk/quickform.php">HTML_QuickForm
    Getting Started Guide</a> by Keith Edmunds. I was pleased to discover that
    he also has a <a
    href="http://www.thelinuxconsultancy.co.uk/smarty-guide.php">guide to
    using Smarty with HTML_QuickForm</a>. I got started with these tutorials,
    and found them excellent. I found myself wanting a little more meat
    afterwards, and found that I could now turn to the PEAR docs and actually
    make sense of it all.
</p>
<p>
    While I think Mr. Edmunds tutorials are great for starters, I found that
    there were a few pointers I could have used right off the bat. I present
    them here for you.

    1.6.2 was tested in a PHP 4.3.4 environment, and features several bugfixes

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Cgiapp 1.6.0, "Wart Removal", has been released!
</p>
<p>
    This release does not add any new methods, but adds quite a lot in terms of
    functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>phpt tests.</b> I finished writing a suite of unit tests using the
    phpt framework popularized by the PHP-QA project and PEAR. This process
    helped me find some obscure bugs in the class, as well as some... well,
    downright ugly code, and to fix these areas. (To be honest, most of the
    'ugly' code was a result of being too literal when porting from perl and not
    using more standard PHP functionality.) Among the bugs fixed:
        <ul>
            <li>s_delete() now works properly.</li>
            <li>param() and s_param() now behave gracefully when given bad data
            (as do a number of other methods)</li>
            <li>_send_headers() and the header_*() suite now function as
            documented.</li>
            <li>All methods now react gracefully to bad input.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Error handling.</b> carp() and croak() no longer echo directly to the
    output stream (and, in the case of croak(), die); they use trigger_error().
    This will allow developers to use carp() and croak() as part of their
    regular arsenal of PHP errors -- including allowing PHP error handling.
    Additionally, most croak() calls in the class were changed to carp() as they
    were not truly fatal errors.</li>
    <li><b>PEAR packaging.</b> Cgiapp can now be installed using PEAR's
    installer. Simply download the package and type 'pear install
    Cgiapp-1.6.0.tgz' to get Cgiapp installed sitewide on your system!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As usual, Cgiapp is available at <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">the Cgiapp website</a>.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    As promised in my earlier entry from today, here's my quick-and-dirty
    tutorial on unit testing in PHP using phpt.
</p>
<p>
    First off, phpt test files, from what I can see, were created as part of the
    <a href="http://qa.php.net/">PHP-QA</a> effort. While I cannot find a link
    within the PHP-QA site, they <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">have
        a page detailing phpt test files</a>, and this page shows all the
    sections of a phpt test file, though they do not necessarily show examples
    of each.
</p>
<p>
    Also, you might find <a
        href="http://www.phpmag.net/itr/kolumnen/psecom,id,26,nodeid,207.html">this
        International PHP Magazine article</a> informative; in it <a
        href="http://www.wormus.com/aaron">Aaron Wormus</a> gives a brief
    tutorial on them, as well as some ways to use phpt tests with PHPUnit.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, before I jump in, I want to note: I am not an expert on unit
    testing. However, the idea behind unit tests is straightforward: keep your
    code simple and modular, and test each little bit (or module) for all types
    of input and output. If the code you're testing is a function or class
    method, test all permutations of arguments that could be passed to it, and
    all possible return values.
</p>
<p>
    Okay, let's jump in!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/64-PHP-Unit-Tests-and-the-winner-is-phpt.html">PHP Unit Tests: and the winner is: phpt</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been tinkering with <a
    href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">Unit
    Testing</a> for around a year now, and have tried using <a
    href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHPUnit">PHP Unit</a> as well as <a
    href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">Simple Test</a>. It was
    while following the Simple Test tutorial that I finally grokked the idea of
    unit testing, and so that has been my favored class for testing.
</p>
<p>
    However, I find writing the tests tedious. In Simple Test, as in PHP Unit,
    you need to create a class that sets up the testing harness, and then you
    create a method for each test you wish to run, and so on... I found it
    incredibly time consuming. Additionally, I found the test harness often felt
    like a foreign way of testing my code; I was setting up a structure I would
    never use my code in, typically. All in all, I only test when I have extra
    time (which is rare) or when I'm really having trouble nailing down bugs
    (and the unit tests often don't help me find them).
</p>
<p>
    Recently, I've been hearing some buzz over on the <a
        href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR</a> lists and the blogs of some of its
    developers about 'phpt' tests. From what I hear, phpt tests sound very
    similar to how one tests in perl (though I've never written perl tests, I've
    at least glanced through them). However, until recently, I haven't seen any
    documentation on them, and installing PEAR packages via pear doesn't install
    tests.
</p>
<p>
    We got a copy of <a href="http://php5powerprogramming.com/">PHP5 Power
        Programming</a> a few weeks ago, and in the section on preparing a PEAR
    package was a brief section on phpt tests. The section was small, and when I
    looked at it, my immediate thought was, "it can't be <em>that</em> simple,
    can it?"
</p>
<p>
    So, I decided to try it out with <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp</a>. A few minutes later, I
    had some working tests for my static methods. "Hmmm," I thought, "That was
    easy. Let's try some more." 
</p>
<p>
    Turns out they're kind of addictive to geeks like me. In a matter of a few
    hours, I'd knocked out tests for over half the functionality, and
    disccovered, to my chagrine and joy, a number of bugs and bad coding
    practices... which I promptly corrected so I could get that magical 'PASS'
    from the test harness.
</p>
<p>
    In the process of writing the tests, my understanding of the tool evolved
    quite a bit, and by the end, I had the knack for it down. I'll blog later
    about some of the ways I made them easier to use for myself -- and how I
    made them more useful for debugging purposes.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/63-Abstract-Classes.html">Abstract Classes</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just had to add a note over on PHP.net regarding abstract classes and
    methods: 
    <a href="http://php.net/language.oop5.abstract">Object Abstraction</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm working on Cgiapp2, which is a PHP5-only implementation of Cgiapp that
    is built to utilize PHP5's new object model as well as exceptions. One thing
    I decided to do, initially, was to make it an abstract class, and to mark
    the overridable methods as abstract as well.
</p>
<p>
    In testing, I started getting some strange errors. Basically, it was saying
    in my class extension that an abstract method existed, and thus the class
    should be marked as abstract, and, finally, that this means it wouldn't run.
</p>
<p>
    What was so odd is that the method didn't exist in the extension at all.
</p>
<p>
    So, I overrode the method in the extension... and voila! Everything worked
    fine.
</p>
<p>
    The lesson to take away from this is quite simple: if the method does not
    need to be present in the overriding class, don't mark it as abstract. Only
    mark a method as abstract if:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The method is required in the class implementation, and</li>
    <li>The extending class should be responsible for implementing said
    method</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now I need to update my source tree.... :-(
