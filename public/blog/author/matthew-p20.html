    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Life is in transition for me now. Two weeks ago, we got to bring our
    handsome baby boy home, and I haven't been sleeping much since (though more
    than Jen). On top of the sleep deprivation, however, comes more exciting
    news: I've been hired as a PHP Developer by <a
        href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend Technologies</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I was approached by Daniel Kushner in late July regarding another position
    at Zend, and was flown out at the beginning of August. While I felt the
    interview went well, I harbored some doubts; work got fairly busy shortly
    thereafter, and then, of course, Liam was born, and the interview went
    completely out of my head. Until about three days after Liam's birthday,
    when Daniel contacted me again about the PHP Developer position.
</p>
<p>
    Work started yesterday, and I was flown to Zend's offices in Cupertino, CA,
    for orientation and to sit down with both Daniel and others to prepare for
    the projects on which I will be working. Thankfully, the job will not
    require that I move, and I will be working out of the 'home office' in
    Vermont when I return later this week.
</p>
<p>
    The decision to leave <a href="http://assoc.garden.org/about">NGA</a> was
    difficult, but the opportunity to work with Zend is just too good to miss. I
    am honored to be selected by them, and hope this is the beginning of many
    good things to come.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/93-File_SMBPasswd-woes.html">File_SMBPasswd woes</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been cobbling together a system at work for the last couple months to
    allow a single place for changing all network passwords. This includes a
    variety of database sources, as well as <i>passwd</i> files and
    <i>smbpasswd</i> files.
    I've been making use of PEAR's <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/File_Passwd">File_Passwd</a> and <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/File_SMBPasswd">File_SMBPasswd</a>, and they've
    greatly simplified the task of updating passwords for those types of
    systems. However, I've encountered some issues that I never would have
    expected.
</p>
<p>
    I have the web user in a group called 'samba', and I have the
    <i>smbpasswd</i> file owned by root:samba. I then set the <i>smbpasswd</i>
    file to be group +rw. Simple, right? The web user should then be able to
    update the <i>smbpasswd</i> file without a problem, right? Wrong.
</p>
<p>
    I kept getting errors, and on investigation continually found that the
    <i>smbpasswd</i> file permissions had reverted to 0600 -- i.e., only the
    root user could access it. I tried using 'chattr -i' on the off-chance that
    the file had been made immutable (which didn't make sense, as I was able to
    see the permissions change). No luck.
</p>
<p>
    Based on observations of when the permissions reverted, it appears that the
    various SMB processes will reset the permissions! An example is when
    someone attempts to mount a resource from the server; this accesses the
    smbpasswd file to perform authentication -- and at this point the file
    permissions change.  I can find no documentation to support this; these are
    simply my observations.
</p>
<p>
    So, to get around the behaviour, I created a script that will set the file
    permissions to what I want them, and then gave <i>sudo</i> privileges to the
    samba group for that script. This script is then called via <i>system()</i>
    in the update script just before processing.
</p>
<p>
    It's a hack, and could be made more secure, but it works.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Last week, we performed a long needed upgrade to the company
    file/print/intranet server. Basically, we'd been on a Redhat 8 system, and
    there were upgrades we were wanting to perform, and couldn't due to lack of
    libraries. We could have possibly compiled from source in some occasions...
    but that would likely have shuttled us into a similar dependency hell as
    using Redhat in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    So, we decided to re-install the OS, and switch to Gentoo in the process.
    We've found that Gentoo is a great distro for servers -- it allows us to
    tailor the install to the server purpose, and simultaneously provides a
    clean upgrade path via portage. 
</p>
<p>
    Things went primarily without a hitch. We lost a few databases due to a bad
    DB backup (argh! there went the wiki!), but that was the primary extent of
    the damage.
</p>
<p>
    When investigating the sytem post-install, I discovered some connectivity
    issues with Samba. Basically, when connecting via a *nix-based machine, we
    were getting symlinks reported as being local to the connecting machine, not
    the server. This meant that symlinks on the server weren't being followed --
    which caused major issues for those connecting via FTP, Mac, or Linux.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Those who follow my blog may remember an <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/83-Thoughts-on-form-validation.html">earlier entry on form validation</a>. I looked into some of the possible
    solutions those who commented provided, but other than <a href="http://solarphp.com/home/index.php?area=Solar_Form">Solar_Form</a>,
    each was either trying to generate HTML, or not generating HTML was
    considered a plugin type of behaviour (i.e., the HTML generation was the
    norm, and not generating HTML typically added layers). Discouraged, I
    continued plugging away on my own solution which was incorporating
    Solar_Valid for validations, adding some filtering, adding the ability to
    load definitions from a file, and adding the ability to use callbacks for
    either filters or validation rules.
</p>
<p>
    I got some code together, tried it out, and felt that either something was
    missing, or I was doing something a little wrong. I posted the code source,
    and asked Paul Jones for feedback.
</p>
<p>
    After some initial flurries of emails with Paul asking for more detail, me
    providing it, Paul asking questions, me attempting to answer...  Paul had me
    look at the source for Solar_Form. In doing so, I discovered what he was
    suspecting, namely, that we were trying to build something similar. Rather
    than continue on parallel courses, I decided to jump in and help in this
    aspect of the <a href="http://solarphp.com/">Solar project</a>.

    This past year, Maeve had a month-long unit on Safaris and jungle animals at
    daycare. One day, she came home singing:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
        On Safari, on Safari,<br />
        In a jeep, in a jeep,<br />
        I can see a lion, I will take a picture,<br />
        Click, click, click. Click, click, click.<br />

<p>
    And so on.
</p>
<p>
    There's a place just over the Quebec border called <a
    href="http://www.parcsafari.com">Parc Safari</a> that we've been hearing
    about, and today we went up there on a family outing -- one of the last that
    we'll have with just the three of us (before little Liam is born).

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Not long ago, as Maeve and I were en route to Jen's work one evening, Maeve
    was being very insistent that certain things were a certain way, and was
    very adamant even as I used a placating tone with her. I asked her,
    jokingly, "Why are you so contrary today?" Her reply?
</p>
<p>
    "Because I'm so smart, and because I'm so right."
</p>
<p>
    I almost wrecked the car as I guffawed. Kids. They're so dang cute. And so

    <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/File_Fortune">File_Fortune</a> has been
    released via <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Changes since the proposal include the addition of a static method for
    retrieving a random fortune from a list of files, the addition of a DocBook
    tutorial listing several usage examples, renaming the exception classes to
    conform to PEAR CS, some minor bugfixes, and some streamlining of the
    package definition.
</p>
<p>
    Included in the release is an example script, phpFortune, that can be used
    on the command line to get random fortunes from one or more fortune files.
    Usage is:
</p>
<pre>
    $> phpFortune fortunes
    $> phpFortune fortunes simpsons hitchhiker
    $> phpFortune
</pre>
<p>
    Enjoy!

    What a way to start the day -- I had an email from PEPR letting me know that
    my <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=263">File_Fortune
    proposal</a> had been accepted!
</p>
<p>
    File_Fortune is a PHP OOP interface to reading and writing fortune files.
    It is loosely based on the perl module Fortune.pm, but modified
    significantly to better work with PHP file access methods, as well as to add
    writing capability.
</p>
<p>
    I will be uploading my initial release shortly, probably as a beta or RC. 
</p>
<p>
    So, go fetch those Simpsons, Hitchhiker's Guide, and Star Wars fortune

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/83-Thoughts-on-form-validation.html">Thoughts on form validation</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been doing a lot of thinking on form validation recently. Among other
    things, I want to be using a standard set of tools for validating form input
    at work; I'm also rewriting the family website in PHP, and want to have
    consistency there as well. Finally, I truly buy into <a
        href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Shiflett's</a> <a
        href="http://shiflett.org/archive/97">top two security practices</a>:
    filter input, escape output. Validation should always be done, and should be
    done rigorously; don't allow anything more than is necessary to get the work
    done.
</p>
<p>
    I flirted briefly in the past month with <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/packages/HTML_QuickForm">HTML_QuickForm</a>.
    Being an observer on the CGI::Application mailing lists, HQF looks like
    PHP's answer to perl's <a
        href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Data%3A%3AFormValidator&mode=module">Data::FormValidator</a>.
    HQF has a high frequency of posts on the php-pear-general lists. A lot of
    people seem happy with it. I decided to try it out as an example plugin for
    <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp</a> for the latest release.
</p>
<p>
    My problem is that I want to be able to define form validation in a file
    outside my script. The reason for this is that as I extend and reuse
    classes, I often find that I can use the same general run-modes for a
    method... just so long as the form validation logic is separate. This allows
    me, for instance, to decide that in one application instance I will require
    fields A-M, but in another, I only need A-E (or vice versa). But it requires
    no changes to the actual application logic, as the validations are kept
    separately, and  I have the application instance indicate which validation
    file to utilize.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
So, last night, Maeve fell asleep in the early evening, on the couch, clutching
her sippy cup and sucking on her bink while watching Scooby Doo. She woke up an
hour later, and after she'd been up for a while and was less groggy, she
announced to Jen and me that, "I'm not going to use my bink ANY MORE. Every
little girl has to give up the bink some time, when they're four, so I'm not
going to use the bink EVER AGAIN." (Imagine dramatic pauses between the all-caps
words there...)
</p>

<p>
This coming from the girl who has a fit every time her bink isn't within
eyesight and reach. Needless to say, we didn't quite believe her, but we were
willing to support her. We told her that if she wants to stop using the bink,
that's okay; it's also okay if she decides to use it again. (Fully expecting
she'd want it within minutes of going to bed.)
</p>

<p>
Well... Maeve slept all night without it, and didn't want it this morning, nor
in the car. She's adamant, our little warrior queen! (Which is what the Gaelic
Maeve translates to in English, in case you were wondering.)
</p>

<p>
I might be jumping the gun here, but I get the feeling our little girl has taken
another step in growing up... and I'm bewildered and a little sad. Much as I've
hated the bink the past year, I also associate it with my little girl... and
she's getting so she's not so little any more!
</p>
<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> I jumped the gun. She <em>did</em> go a full 24 hours, but the
following night decided she wanted the bink again. But there <em>is</em> hope
for a bink-less future...
