I don't know why I never bothered to look this up, but I didn't. One thing I

this is unnecessary: use $smarty.server.KEY_NAME to access any $_SERVER vars

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    It's now been confirmed: I'm a geek. 
</p>
<p>
    Okay, so that probably comes as no shocker to those of you who know me, but
    it's the little things that make me realize it myself.
</p>
<p>
    I've been frequenting <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a> for
    a couple of years now, mainly to garner ideas and code to help me with my
    personal or work projects. I rarely post comments, and I've only once
    submitted a question to the site. However, I <strong>do</strong> frequent
    the site regularly, and the few comments I've put in -- generally regarding
    usage of <a href="http::/search.cpan.org/search?query=CGI%3A%3AApplication">CGI::Application</a>
    -- have been typically well-moderated.
</p>
<p>
    Well, yesterday I <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408255">made a comment</a> to a user <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408231">asking about editors to
        use with perl</a>. I was incensed by a remark he made about <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> not having the features he needed.
    Now, as I said in my comment, I've used VIM on a daily basis for over two
    years, and I'm <em>still</em> discovering new features -- and I've used all
    of the features he was looking for.
</p>
<p>
    This is where I discovered I'm a geek: my comment made it into the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=Best%20Nodes">Daily
    Best</a> for today, peaking around number 5. The fact that that made my day
    indicates to me that I <em>must</em> be a geek.
</p>
<p>
    Oh -- and VIM rules!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    At work this week, I discovered a bug with how I was calling
    set_error_handler() in Cgiapp's run() method. Evidently passing a reference
    in a PHP callback causes issues! So, I corrected that.
</p>
<p>
    I also made a minor, one-character change to query() to make it explicitly
    return a reference to the $_CGIAPP_REQUEST property array.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Cgiapp 1.5 has been released; you may now <a href="download?mode=view_download&id=11">download it</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This release fixes a subtle bug I hadn't encountered before; namely, when a
    method name or function name is passed as an argument to mode_param(), run()
    was receiving the requested run mode... and then attempting to process that
    as the mode param. The behaviour is now fixed, and is actually simpler than
    the previous (non-working) behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    Also, on reading <a href="http://shiflett.org">Chris Shiflet's</a> paper on
    PHP security, I decided to reinstate the query() method. I had been using
    $_REQUEST to check for a run mode parameter; because this combines the GET,
    POST, <b>and</b> COOKIE arrays, it's considered a bit of a security risk.
    query() now creates a combined array of GET and POST variable (POST taking
    precedence over GET) and stores them in the property $_CGIAPP_REQUEST; it
    returns a reference to that property. run() uses that property to determine
    the run mode now.
</p>
<p>
    Enjoy!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been playing with parameter testing in my various Cgiapp classes, and
    one test that seemed pretty slick was the following:
</p>
<pre>
    if (!array_key_exists('some_string', $_REQUEST)) {
        // some error
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Seems pretty straight-forward: $_REQUEST is an associative array, and I want
    to test for the existence of a key in it. Sure, I could use isset(), but it
    seemed...  ugly, and verbose, and a waste of keystrokes, particularly when
    I'm using the param() method:
</p>
<pre>
    if (!isset($_REQUEST[$this->param('some_param')])) {
        // some error
    }
</pre>
<p>
    However, I ran into a pitfall: when it comes to array_key_exists(),
    $_REQUEST isn't exactly an array. I think what's going on is that $_REQUEST
    is actually a superset of several other arrays -- $_POST, $_GET, and
    $_COOKIE -- and isset() has some logic to descend amongst the various keys,
    while array_key_exists() can only work on a single level.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever the explanation, I ended up reverting a bunch of code. :-(

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Inspired by a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/2016211">Slashdot book
        review</a> of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hpmysql/index.html">High
        Performance MySQL</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I've often suspected that I'm not a SQL guru... little things like being
    self taught and having virtually no resources for learning it. This has been
    confirmed to a large degree at work, where our DBA has taught me many tricks
    about databases: indexing, when to use DISTINCT, how and when to do JOINs,
    and the magic of TEMPORARY TABLEs. I now feel fairly competent, though far
    from being an expert -- I certainly don't know much about how to tune a
    server for MySQL, or tuning MySQL for performance.
</p>
<p>
    Last year around this time, we needed to replace our MySQL server, and I
    got handed the job of getting the data from the old one onto the new. At the
    time, I looked into replication, and from there discovered about binary
    copies of a data store. I started using this as a way to backup data,
    instead of periodic mysqldumps.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I've often wondered since: would replication be a good way to do
    backups? It seems like it would, but I haven't investigated.
    One post on the aforementioned Slashdot article addressed this, with the
    following summary:
</p>
<ol>
     <li>Set up replication</li>
     <li>Do a locked table backup on the slave</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Concise and to the point. I only wish I had a spare server on which to
    implement it!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've standardized my PHP programming to use the environment variable
    <b>SCRIPT_NAME</b> when I want my script to refer to itself in links and
    form actions. I've known that <b>PHP_SELF</b> has the same information, but
    I was more familiar with the name 'SCRIPT_NAME' from using it in perl, and
    liked the feel of it more as it seems to describe the resource better
    ('PHP_SELF' could stand for the path to the PHP executable if I were to go
    by the name only).
</p>
<p>
    However, I just noticed a post on the php.general newsgroup where somebody
    asked what the difference was between them. Semantically, there isn't any;
    they should contain the same information. However, historically and
    technically speaking, there is. <b>SCRIPT_NAME</b> is defined in the CGI 1.1
    specification, and is thus a standard. <em>However</em>, not all web servers
    actually implement it, and thus it isn't necessarily <em>portable</em>.
    <b>PHP_SELF</b>, on the other hand, is implemented directly by PHP, and as
    long as you're programming in PHP, will always be present.
</p>
<p>
    Guess I have some grep and sed in my future as I change a bunch of
    scripts...

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Occasionally, I've needed to process a lot of information from a script, but
    I don't want to worry about PHP timing out or the user aborting the script
    (by clicking on another link or closing the window). Initially, I
    investigated <a href="http://php.net/register_shutdown_function">register_shutdown_function()</a>
    for this; it will fire off a process once the page finishes loading.
    Unfortunately, the process is still a part of the current connection, so it
    can be aborted in the same way as any other script (i.e., by hitting stop,
    closing the browser, going to a new link, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    However, there's another setting initialized via a function that can
    override this behaviour -- i.e., let the script continue running after the
    abort. This is <a href="http://php.net/ignore_user_abort">ignore_user_abort()</a>. By
    setting this to true, your script will continue running after the fact.
</p>
<p>
    This sort of thing would be especially good for bulk uploads where the
    upload needs to be processed -- say, for instance, a group of images or
    email addresses.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/43-Practical-PHP-Programming.html">Practical PHP Programming</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In the past two days, I've seen two references to <a href="http://www.hudzilla.org/php/">Practical PHP Programming</a>, an
    online book that serves both as an introduction to programming with PHP5 and
    MySQL as well as a good advanced reference with many good tips.
</p>
<p>
    This evening, I was browsing through the Performance chapter (chapter 18),
    and found a number of cool things, both for PHP and MySQL. Many were common
    sense things that I've been doing for awhile, but which I've also seen and
    shaken my head at in code I've seen from others (calculating loop
    invariables at every iteration, not using variables passed to a function,
    not returning a value from a function, not using a return value from a
    function). Others were new and gave me pause for thought (string
    concatenation with the '.' operator is expensive, especially when done more
    than once in an operation; echo can take a comma separated list).
</p>
<p>
    Some PHP myths were also dispelled, some of which I've been wondering about
    for awhile. For instance, the amount of comments and whitespace in PHP are
    not a factor in performance (and PHP caching systems will often strip them
    out anyways); double quotes are not more expensive than single quotes unless
    variable interpolation occurs.
</p>
<p>
    It also has some good advice for SQL optimization, and, more importantly,
    MySQL <em>server</em> optimization. For instance, the author suggests
    running 'OPTIMIZE TABLE table;' on any table that has been
    added/updated/deleted from to any large extent since creation; this will
    defrag the table and give it better performance. Use CHAR() versus
    VARCHAR(); VARCHAR() saves on space, but MySQL has to calculate how much
    space was used each time it queries in order to determine where the next
    field or record starts. However, if you have any variable length fields, you
    may as well use as many as you need -- or split off variable length fields
    (such as a TEXT() field) into a different table in order to speed up
    searching. When performing JOINs, compare on numeric fields instead of
    character fields, and always JOIN on rows that are indexed.
</p>
<p>
    I haven't read the entire book, but glancing through the TOC, there are some
    potential downfalls to its content:

<ul>
    <li>It doesn't cover PhpDoc</li>
    <li>It doesn't appear to cover unit testing</li>
    <li>Limited coverage of templating solutions (though they are mentioned)</li>
    <li>Limited usage of PEAR. The author does mention PEAR a number of times,
    and often indicates that use of certain PEAR modules is preferable to using
    the corresponding low-level PHP calls (e.g., Mail and Mail_MIME, DB), but in
    the examples rarely uses them.</li>
    <li>PHP-HTML-PHP... The examples I browsed all created self-contained
    scripts that did all HTML output. While I can appreciate this to a degree,
    I'd still like to see a book that shows OOP development in PHP <em>and which
    creates re-usable web components</em> in doing so. For instance, instead of
    creating a message board <em>script</em>, create a message board
    <em>class</em> that can be called from anywhere with metadata specifying the
    database and templates to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All told, there's plenty of meat in this book -- I wish it were in dead tree
    format already so I could browse through it at my leisure, instead of in
    front of the computer.
