    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Those of you who know me well know that I've been using Linux as my primary
    OS for many years now. At this point, for me, using Windows is like deciding
    I'm going to use a limited vocabulary; I can get the idea across, but not
    quite as well.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the nature of where I work and the fact that I'm telecommuting, I've
    been having to maintain a dual-boot system. I use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> for my daily OS, and boot into
    Windows when I need to interact with people at work via <a href="http://www.webex.com/">Webex</a> or 
    <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> (we're using the new Skype beta
    with video, and it only works on Windows XP at this time).
</p>
<p>
    This week, however, I've had to stay on Windows quite a bit -- lots of
    impromptu conference calls and such. So, I've been customizing my
    environment, and been pretty pleased with the results.
</p>
<p>
    Continue reading for some tips on customizing your Windows XP environment to
    work and feel a little more like... linux.

    Don't know if this is actually possible, but it appears Liam is already
    starting to associate names with people!
</p>
<p>
    Just now, Jen was holding Liam, and turned him to face Maeve and I, who were
    sitting on the couch. He wasn't looking anywhere in particular. Then, Jen
    said, "Hi, Papa!" and his eyes moved to focus on me. A moment later, she
    said, "Hi, big sister!" and he moved is eyes to focus on Maeve.
</p>
<p>
    As I type this, Jen just tried the experiment again with Maeve, and again he
    moved his eyes and head to look at her!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was able to roll a long-needed (and by some, long awaited) bugfix release
    of Cgiapp this morning. Cgiapp 1.7.1 corrects the following issues:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cgiapp5::run() was corrected to call query() instead of
    cgiapp_get_query() (which caused a fatal error)</li>
    <li>Cgiapp::__call() and Cgiapp5::__call() now report the name of the method
    called in errors when unable to find matching actions for that method.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As usual, downloads are available <a href="/matthew/download">on my site</a> as well as <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cgiapp/Cgiapp-1.7.1.tgz?download">via SourceForge</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update:</b> The link on my site for downloading Cgiapp has been broken;
    I've now fixed it.

    I ran across an article on <a href="http://www.phpit.net/article/build-caching-system-php/trackback/">"How to build a simple caching system, with PHP"</a> 
    on PHPit today. Overall, it's a fairly decent article, and uses some good
    principles (using the output buffer to capture content, using a callback to
    grab the captured content). There are a few minor improvements I'd make, however.

    Shiflett's PHP Security talk, and a crash course on the ZCE. However, it's

    I flew in to San Jose today to visit Zend, and later attend the 
    <a href="http://zend.kbconferences.com">Zend/PHP Conference and Expo</a>
    (two days left... <a href="http://guest.cvent.com/i.aspx?5S,M3,a72c7fa1-43cb-4e9f-8b8e-a8b0ed99b197">register now</a> 
    if you haven't, and have the time to attend; the conference sessions promise
    to be <em>very</em> interesting).
</p>
<p>
    During the flight, I had plenty of time to go through 
    <a href="http://ilia.ws">Ilia's</a> <em>Guide to PHP Security</em>, which
    I'd ordered several weeks ago, but hadn't had time to read since.

    Around the time I was hired by Zend, I was asked, along with 
    <a href="http://www.6502.org/users/mike/blog/">Mike Naberezny</a>, to fill
    in for a tutorial session entitled 'Setting up PHP' for the 
    <a href="http://zend.kbconferences.com/">upcoming Zend/PHP Conference and Expo</a>. 
    The basic premise of the session is to give a step-by-step tutorial on how
    to setup and configure PHP for various scenarios, such as development,
    testing, and production.
</p>
<p>
    Mike and I have been working in parallel developing ideas and outlines for
    the session, and I'm fairly excited to have the opportunity. However, if
    you're attending the conference and, in particular, this session, I'd love
    to hear any input you might have -- any tricks you'd love to learn,
    configuration settings you don't understand, use cases you might need. Leave
    a comment!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Life is in transition for me now. Two weeks ago, we got to bring our
    handsome baby boy home, and I haven't been sleeping much since (though more
    than Jen). On top of the sleep deprivation, however, comes more exciting
    news: I've been hired as a PHP Developer by <a
        href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend Technologies</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I was approached by Daniel Kushner in late July regarding another position
    at Zend, and was flown out at the beginning of August. While I felt the
    interview went well, I harbored some doubts; work got fairly busy shortly
    thereafter, and then, of course, Liam was born, and the interview went
    completely out of my head. Until about three days after Liam's birthday,
    when Daniel contacted me again about the PHP Developer position.
</p>
<p>
    Work started yesterday, and I was flown to Zend's offices in Cupertino, CA,
    for orientation and to sit down with both Daniel and others to prepare for
    the projects on which I will be working. Thankfully, the job will not
    require that I move, and I will be working out of the 'home office' in
    Vermont when I return later this week.
</p>
<p>
    The decision to leave <a href="http://assoc.garden.org/about">NGA</a> was
    difficult, but the opportunity to work with Zend is just too good to miss. I
    am honored to be selected by them, and hope this is the beginning of many
    good things to come.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/93-File_SMBPasswd-woes.html">File_SMBPasswd woes</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been cobbling together a system at work for the last couple months to
    allow a single place for changing all network passwords. This includes a
    variety of database sources, as well as <i>passwd</i> files and
    <i>smbpasswd</i> files.
    I've been making use of PEAR's <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/File_Passwd">File_Passwd</a> and <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/File_SMBPasswd">File_SMBPasswd</a>, and they've
    greatly simplified the task of updating passwords for those types of
    systems. However, I've encountered some issues that I never would have
    expected.
</p>
<p>
    I have the web user in a group called 'samba', and I have the
    <i>smbpasswd</i> file owned by root:samba. I then set the <i>smbpasswd</i>
    file to be group +rw. Simple, right? The web user should then be able to
    update the <i>smbpasswd</i> file without a problem, right? Wrong.
</p>
<p>
    I kept getting errors, and on investigation continually found that the
    <i>smbpasswd</i> file permissions had reverted to 0600 -- i.e., only the
    root user could access it. I tried using 'chattr -i' on the off-chance that
    the file had been made immutable (which didn't make sense, as I was able to
    see the permissions change). No luck.
</p>
<p>
    Based on observations of when the permissions reverted, it appears that the
    various SMB processes will reset the permissions! An example is when
    someone attempts to mount a resource from the server; this accesses the
    smbpasswd file to perform authentication -- and at this point the file
    permissions change.  I can find no documentation to support this; these are
    simply my observations.
</p>
<p>
    So, to get around the behaviour, I created a script that will set the file
    permissions to what I want them, and then gave <i>sudo</i> privileges to the
    samba group for that script. This script is then called via <i>system()</i>
    in the update script just before processing.
</p>
<p>
    It's a hack, and could be made more secure, but it works.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/89-Server-upgrades%2C-samba%2C-and-permissions%2C-oh-my%21.html">Server upgrades, samba, and permissions, oh my!</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Last week, we performed a long needed upgrade to the company
    file/print/intranet server. Basically, we'd been on a Redhat 8 system, and
    there were upgrades we were wanting to perform, and couldn't due to lack of
    libraries. We could have possibly compiled from source in some occasions...
    but that would likely have shuttled us into a similar dependency hell as
    using Redhat in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    So, we decided to re-install the OS, and switch to Gentoo in the process.
    We've found that Gentoo is a great distro for servers -- it allows us to
    tailor the install to the server purpose, and simultaneously provides a
    clean upgrade path via portage. 
</p>
<p>
    Things went primarily without a hitch. We lost a few databases due to a bad
    DB backup (argh! there went the wiki!), but that was the primary extent of
    the damage.
</p>
<p>
    When investigating the sytem post-install, I discovered some connectivity
    issues with Samba. Basically, when connecting via a *nix-based machine, we
    were getting symlinks reported as being local to the connecting machine, not
    the server. This meant that symlinks on the server weren't being followed --
    which caused major issues for those connecting via FTP, Mac, or Linux.
