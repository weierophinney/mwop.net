    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Those who follow my blog may remember an <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/83-Thoughts-on-form-validation.html">earlier entry on form validation</a>. I looked into some of the possible
    solutions those who commented provided, but other than <a href="http://solarphp.com/home/index.php?area=Solar_Form">Solar_Form</a>,
    each was either trying to generate HTML, or not generating HTML was
    considered a plugin type of behaviour (i.e., the HTML generation was the
    norm, and not generating HTML typically added layers). Discouraged, I
    continued plugging away on my own solution which was incorporating
    Solar_Valid for validations, adding some filtering, adding the ability to
    load definitions from a file, and adding the ability to use callbacks for
    either filters or validation rules.
</p>
<p>
    I got some code together, tried it out, and felt that either something was
    missing, or I was doing something a little wrong. I posted the code source,
    and asked Paul Jones for feedback.
</p>
<p>
    After some initial flurries of emails with Paul asking for more detail, me
    providing it, Paul asking questions, me attempting to answer...  Paul had me
    look at the source for Solar_Form. In doing so, I discovered what he was
    suspecting, namely, that we were trying to build something similar. Rather
    than continue on parallel courses, I decided to jump in and help in this
    aspect of the <a href="http://solarphp.com/">Solar project</a>.

    This past year, Maeve had a month-long unit on Safaris and jungle animals at
    daycare. One day, she came home singing:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
        On Safari, on Safari,<br />
        In a jeep, in a jeep,<br />
        I can see a lion, I will take a picture,<br />

    we'll have with just the three of us (before little Liam is born).

    Not long ago, as Maeve and I were en route to Jen's work one evening, Maeve
    was being very insistent that certain things were a certain way, and was
    very adamant even as I used a placating tone with her. I asked her,
    jokingly, "Why are you so contrary today?" Her reply?

<p>
    "Because I'm so smart, and because I'm so right."

    <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/File_Fortune">File_Fortune</a> has been

</p>
<p>
    Changes since the proposal include the addition of a static method for
    retrieving a random fortune from a list of files, the addition of a DocBook
    tutorial listing several usage examples, renaming the exception classes to
    conform to PEAR CS, some minor bugfixes, and some streamlining of the
    package definition.
</p>
<p>
    Included in the release is an example script, phpFortune, that can be used
    on the command line to get random fortunes from one or more fortune files.
    Usage is:
</p>
<pre>
    $> phpFortune fortunes
    $> phpFortune fortunes simpsons hitchhiker
    $> phpFortune
</pre>
<p>
    Enjoy!

    What a way to start the day -- I had an email from PEPR letting me know that
    my <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=263">File_Fortune
    proposal</a> had been accepted!
</p>
<p>
    File_Fortune is a PHP OOP interface to reading and writing fortune files.
    It is loosely based on the perl module Fortune.pm, but modified
    significantly to better work with PHP file access methods, as well as to add
    writing capability.
</p>
<p>
    I will be uploading my initial release shortly, probably as a beta or RC. 
</p>
<p>
    So, go fetch those Simpsons, Hitchhiker's Guide, and Star Wars fortune
    cookie databases and prepare to add random quotes to your site!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been doing a lot of thinking on form validation recently. Among other
    things, I want to be using a standard set of tools for validating form input
    at work; I'm also rewriting the family website in PHP, and want to have
    consistency there as well. Finally, I truly buy into <a
        href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Shiflett's</a> <a
        href="http://shiflett.org/archive/97">top two security practices</a>:
    filter input, escape output. Validation should always be done, and should be
    done rigorously; don't allow anything more than is necessary to get the work
    done.
</p>
<p>
    I flirted briefly in the past month with <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/packages/HTML_QuickForm">HTML_QuickForm</a>.
    Being an observer on the CGI::Application mailing lists, HQF looks like
    PHP's answer to perl's <a
        href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Data%3A%3AFormValidator&mode=module">Data::FormValidator</a>.
    HQF has a high frequency of posts on the php-pear-general lists. A lot of
    people seem happy with it. I decided to try it out as an example plugin for
    <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">Cgiapp</a> for the latest release.
</p>
<p>
    My problem is that I want to be able to define form validation in a file
    outside my script. The reason for this is that as I extend and reuse
    classes, I often find that I can use the same general run-modes for a
    method... just so long as the form validation logic is separate. This allows
    me, for instance, to decide that in one application instance I will require
    fields A-M, but in another, I only need A-E (or vice versa). But it requires
    no changes to the actual application logic, as the validations are kept
    separately, and  I have the application instance indicate which validation
    file to utilize.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
So, last night, Maeve fell asleep in the early evening, on the couch, clutching
her sippy cup and sucking on her bink while watching Scooby Doo. She woke up an
hour later, and after she'd been up for a while and was less groggy, she
announced to Jen and me that, "I'm not going to use my bink ANY MORE. Every
little girl has to give up the bink some time, when they're four, so I'm not
going to use the bink EVER AGAIN." (Imagine dramatic pauses between the all-caps
words there...)
</p>

<p>
This coming from the girl who has a fit every time her bink isn't within
eyesight and reach. Needless to say, we didn't quite believe her, but we were
willing to support her. We told her that if she wants to stop using the bink,
that's okay; it's also okay if she decides to use it again. (Fully expecting
she'd want it within minutes of going to bed.)
</p>

<p>
Well... Maeve slept all night without it, and didn't want it this morning, nor
in the car. She's adamant, our little warrior queen! (Which is what the Gaelic
Maeve translates to in English, in case you were wondering.)
</p>

<p>
I might be jumping the gun here, but I get the feeling our little girl has taken
another step in growing up... and I'm bewildered and a little sad. Much as I've
hated the bink the past year, I also associate it with my little girl... and
she's getting so she's not so little any more!
</p>
<p>
<b>UPDATE:</b> I jumped the gun. She <em>did</em> go a full 24 hours, but the
following night decided she wanted the bink again. But there <em>is</em> hope
for a bink-less future...

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/81-Notes-on-PEAR_Exception.html">Notes on PEAR_Exception</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been doing some thinking on exceptions, and <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/package/PEAR/docs/1.3.3.1/PEAR/PEAR_Exception.html">PEAR_Exception</a> in
    particular. You may want to skip ahead to read about how to use
    PEAR_Exception, as well as some of my thoughts on the class on first use. If
    you want the background, read on.
</p>
<p>
    I've created a package proposal on PEAR for a package called <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=263">File_Fortune</a>,
    an OOP interface to reading and writing fortune files. I've been using a
    perl module for this on the family website for years, and now that I'm
    starting work on the PHP conversion, I thought I'd start with the building
    blocks.
</p>
<p>
    In creating the proposal, I started with a PHP5-only version, though I found
    that I wasn't using much in PHP5 beyond the public/private/protected/static
    keywords. For error handling, I decided to try out <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/packages/PEAR_ErrorStack">PEAR_ErrorStack</a>,
    as I'd been hearing buzz about it being the new "preferred" method for error
    handling in PEAR. (Honestly, after using it, I'm not too happy with it;
    throwing PEAR_Errors was much easier, and easier to manipulate as well --
    but that's a subject for another post -- and exceptions were easier still,
    though more typing.)
</p>
<p>
    The first comment I got on the proposal was <em>the</em> question: "Why
    PHP5?" (<a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul</a> wasn't too
    surprised by that reaction.) I thought about it, and decided it wasn't
    really all that necessary, beyond the fact that I'd need to take some extra
    steps to be able to actually test a PHP4 version. So, I did a PHP4 version.
</p>
<p>
    Well, then some chatter happened, and a number of developers said, "Why
    <em>not</em> PHP5?" So, I went back to PHP5. And then somebody else said,
    "Use PEAR_Exception." So, I started playing with that, and we finally get to
    the subject of this post.

    <div class="entry body"><p> <a href="http://www.paul-m-jones.com/">Paul Jones</a> has written <a href="http://www.paul-m-jones.com/blog/?p=153">an interesting piece about documentation in the PEAR project</a>, in which he argues very convincingly for using wikis for end user documentation.</p>
<p>
    I actually think that last point bears repeating: <em>using wikis for end
        user documentation</em>. I talked to Paul about this issue at
    php|Tropics, and both of us use phpDocumentor quite religiously. However,
    API documentation is very different from end user documentation. And the
    issue with documentation at the PEAR project has to do with the fact that
    there are many projects with little or no end user documentation -- which
    often makes it difficult for a developer to determine how a module might be
    used.
</p>
<p>
    The often-cited barrier for this is that end user documentation on the PEAR
    website must be done in DocBook format.
