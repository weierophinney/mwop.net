    <content xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" type="xhtml">
      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I've been using <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</xhtml:a> for close
to a decade. I've often said that <xhtml:em>"Unix is my IDE"</xhtml:em> --
because Vim is built in the Unix philosophy, allowing me to pipe
input into it, out of it, and every which way I want. It fits very
nicely with the Unix philosophy of doing one task well, and
allowing redirection. I've found it ideal for web development in
general and PHP development specifically -- in fact, I've had
excellent experiences in every language I've tried my hand at
developing in when using Vim.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Vim is also my chosen productivity suite. When I want to write a
document, I don't go into OO.o Writer or MS Word or some other word
processor; I open up a window and start typing. In most cases, I
can either cut and paste my work into other tools, or pipe it to
transformation tools. I worry about the <xhtml:em>content</xhtml:em> first, and
the <xhtml:em>presentation</xhtml:em> later... like any good MVC application.
;-)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Like any good tool, you have to invest time in it in order to
reap its benefits. My learning has, to date, fallen into three time
periods:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>The initial months in which I first learned Vim, via vimtutor
and Steve Oualline's Vim book.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>A period in 2006-2007 when I felt the need to make my coding
more efficient, and first started playing with exuberant-ctags and
omni-completion.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>The last quarter of 2010 (yes, that's now) when I was
introduced to a number of new tools via Twitter.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>So, this is my Vim Toolbox, 2010 edition.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.1">Getting Plugins</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>I've added two primary ways to add new plugins to my
arsenal:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="https://github.com/c9s/Vimana">Vimana</xhtml:a>, which is a
command-line tool for discovering, downloading, installing, and
upgrading scripts found on <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org">vim.org</xhtml:a>. It's not perfect, but if you know
the name of the script, and it's provided in either a <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502">vimball</xhtml:a>
format and/or follows the Vim runtime file structure, it's a great
way to keep your plugins, syntax files, etc. up-to-date.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen">Vim
Pathogen</xhtml:a> allows you to install plugins as "bundles", allowing
you to keep them up-to-date separately, in their own file tree.
This looks like the following:
<xhtml:pre>
.vim/
    bundle/
        vim-task/
            ftdetect/
            ftplugin/
            syntax/
</xhtml:pre>
In short, a "bundle" mimics the structure of a Vim directory.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>The latter, Pathogen, is my preferred installation method of
choice at this point. Why? One acronym: DVCS.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>A ton of popular Vim plugins are now being either developed or
mirrored on GitHub or other DVCS sites. This allows you to clone
them and then create a branch that's specific to your
configuration. As an example, the popular <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540">snipMate
plugin</xhtml:a> has its key-bindings hard-coded -- which causes problems
if you're already using those bindings. Which, if you're using any
form of omni-completion, is all too likely. I simply <xhtml:a href="https://github.com/weierophinney/snipmate.vim">cloned the snipMate
repo</xhtml:a>, and created a branch for my configuration (I use
<xhtml:code>&lt;Leader&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</xhtml:code> to invoke it).</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Now, it gets even better: I've made <xhtml:a href="http://git.mwop.net/?a=summary&amp;p=vimrc">a git repository for
my Vim configuration</xhtml:a>; with judicious use of <xhtml:code>git
submodule</xhtml:code>, I can now add pathogen bundles as submodules of
my repository. Right now, I've got bundles for html5.vim,
mustache.vim, NErdtree, snipMate, TagList, vim-fugitive, vim-task,
and vimwiki. This keeps my repository lean, while retaining the
features I need and use daily.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>As part of creating my Vim configuration repository, I also made
a few changes to facilitate the process. First, I moved
<xhtml:code>$HOME/.vimrc</xhtml:code> to <xhtml:code>$HOME/.vim/vimrc</xhtml:code>, and
symlinked the former to the latter. This allows me to keep all my
Vim configuration in one place.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Next, I moved my Vim view files outside the directory; this data
is volatile and constantly changing, and really does not need to be
versioned. These are now in my <xhtml:code>$HOME/.vim.view/</xhtml:code>
directory. Finally, I moved my tag files into a new
<xhtml:code>$HOME/.vim.tags/</xhtml:code> directory. More on that later, but,
again, the rationale is that this data is volatile and does not
need to be versioned.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.2">DVCS</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>I mentioned I created a Git repository for my Vim configuration.
In part, this is due to the fact that I'm proficient with Git -- I
use it day-in, day-out. Hg and other DVCS systems are also great;
I'm not using them nearly as often, however.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>To that end, I'm now using <xhtml:a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</xhtml:a>. The
author boasts that it's "a Git wrapper so awesome, it should be
illegal"; I wouldn't necessarily go that far, but I do find it
incredibly useful. While I'm typically working in a console, I also
find myself in GVim windows regularly as well -- and having a nice,
familiar interface to Git is very useful. If you use both Vim and
Git, I highly recommend checking out vim-fugitive.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.3">Filesystem Navigation and Projects</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>At some point, unless you're one of those developers who likes
to code everything in a single file, you need to do some sort of
navigation. A couple years back, <xhtml:a href="http://zmievski.org/">Andrei Zmievski</xhtml:a> introduced me to
<xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NErdtree</xhtml:a>,
a dead-simple, colorized navigation. I use this every. single.
day.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I also use a tool called <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69">Project</xhtml:a>.
This tool allows you to specify "files of interest" to a project --
either by automatically scanning a tree, or manually. Additionally,
the way you specify the hierarchy can be entirely arbitrary --
allowing you to flatten the tree when it's getting in the way. I
use this tool regularly as well, though not quite as much as
NErdtree.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.4">Navigating Code</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>One often touted feature of modern IDEs is code completion and
hinting. These are definitely useful features, particularly when
working on unfamiliar code, or code you haven't touched in some
time.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Vim actually has some great tools for this already. One is
built-in: omni-completion (<xhtml:code>:he new-omni-completion</xhtml:code> for
Vim's help on the feature). By default, it inspects the files in
open buffers to provide completion (assuming it has a definition
for that language and/or syntax highlighting) -- but it can also
utilize <xhtml:em>tag</xhtml:em> files.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The built-in omni-completion for PHP is reasonable -- you can
jump around by class names, function/method names, variables, etc.
It gets much, much more useful, however, when you utilize tag
files, as you don't need the files already open in order to get
completion. I've <xhtml:a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/134-exuberant-ctags-with-PHP-in-Vim.html">
blogged about ctags before</xhtml:a>; however, I've updated my scripts a
bit.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>First, exuberant-ctags is much more PHP aware now than when I
blogged. This means you don't need to do any special regex-fu in
order to properly identify abstract classes, interfaces, and
methods. Second, I found that I could generate a single script with
prompts to indicate the directory and tag file name. <xhtml:a href="http://git.mwop.net/?a=viewblob&amp;p=vimrc&amp;h=3a8ca75bcd6a28dbea2cee02f31d72e82f415e5b&amp;hb=c1a728c96fa593be5c570c78cac5dcb2b7052fd3&amp;f=bin/mkTags">
That script</xhtml:a> basically looks like this:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="sh" xml:lang="sh">
#!/bin/sh
dir=\"\"
name=\"\"
if [ $# -ge 2 ] ; then
    # Two arguments: first is directory, second is \"alias\"
    dir=$1
    name=$2
else
    if [ $# -eq 1 ] ; then
        # One argument: use as directory, and use basename of directory as alias
        dir=$1
        name=`basename $1`
    else
        # Otherwise: prompt
        echo \"Enter the path to a directory containing PHP code you wish\"
        echo \"to create tags for:\"
        read dir
        echo \"Enter the name of the tagfile you wish to create:\"
        read name
    fi
fi

echo \"Creating tags for directory '$dir' using alias '$name'\"
cd $dir
exec ctags-exuberant -f ~/.vim.tags/$name \
-h \".php\" -R \
--exclude=\"\.svn\" \
--totals=yes \
--tag-relative=yes \
--fields=+afkst \
--PHP-kinds=+cf 
echo \"[DONE]\"
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>Two things to note:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>It creates the tag files in <xhtml:code>$HOME/.vim.tags/</xhtml:code>. I do
this as my tag files change fairly regularly, and can be
re-generated on the fly as needed. There's no reason to version
them.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Once generated, you need to load them. I created a "LoadTags"
Vim function that will load a tag file by the given name from the
<xhtml:code>$HOME/.vim.tags/</xhtml:code> directory. By default, I load the
ones I most commonly use (ZF1, ZF2, PHPUnit). Otherwise, a quick
<xhtml:code>:Ltag &lt;tag filename&gt;</xhtml:code> will load on-demand.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>Once the tags are created, you can use Vim's normal tag features
to load files, jump to files, etc. The most common commands I use
are:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:code>:stag &lt;tagname&gt;</xhtml:code>, which splits the current
window and loads the given tag in the newly created split.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:code>&lt;Ctrl-w&gt;]</xhtml:code>, when on text you suspect of being
a tag (such as a classname), will split the current window and load
that tag file in the new pane.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>These two commands I use constantly, and are huge timesavers --
I can basically use the code as my documentation.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Additionally, the main use of omni-completion is to give
tab-completion for known tags. This means that you can start
typing, hit <xhtml:code>&lt;Tab&gt;</xhtml:code>, and either have it
immediately complete, or give you a list of potential matches. It's
not quite as useful as a good IDE -- it's not context-aware, so
you'll get <xhtml:strong>any</xhtml:strong> potential match from
<xhtml:strong>any</xhtml:strong> class -- but it's better than nothing,
provides reasonable hinting, and helps protect you from spelling
errors.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>That said, there's also something to be said about just having
the signatures and prototypes of the various methods easily
accessible. For that, there's the <xhtml:a href="http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/">Vim TagList</xhtml:a> plugin. This
plugin will scan open files and produce a list of classes,
variables, and methods. With this list, you can get the method
prototypes, as well as jump directly to their definitions. Pressing
<xhtml:code>&lt;Space&gt;</xhtml:code> will show you the prototype,
<xhtml:code>&lt;CR&gt;</xhtml:code> will jump to it.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Between these two features (omni-completion with tags and
TagList), I have most of the useful features of any IDE immediately
available.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.5">Working With Code</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>Since I sling code for a living, it's useful to have some
plugins and syntax highlighting to make working with code
easier.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>First off, I've been experimenting with HTML5; as such, I added
the <xhtml:a href="https://github.com/othree/html5.vim">html5.vim</xhtml:a>
syntax highlighting as a Pathogen module. This adds support for a
bunch of HTML5-specific features, while retaining the fantastic
HTML support already in the official HTML syntax provided with
Vim.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Next, I use the <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=967">php.vim</xhtml:a>
syntax file from vim.org. This particular syntax file has support
for PHP 5.3 features, which come in very handy while I'm coding for
ZF2. The author of this syntax has also created a script
(<xhtml:code>php_vimgen.php</xhtml:code>) for generating syntax files for core
classes as well as extensions using the Reflection API. I've
modified the tool in my repository to strip out the generated
syntax, and instead source it from the file created with the
<xhtml:code>php_vimgen.php</xhtml:code> script; I've also altered said script
to create the syntax in <xhtml:code>__DIR__ .
'/php_syntax_vimgen.vim'</xhtml:code>, ensuring I can always source it
from the same location. This allows me to keep my PHP syntax
highlighting up-to-date.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Finally, I use <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540">snipMate</xhtml:a>,
a tool that emulates TextMate's "snippet" features. Basically, this
is dead-simple, templated code generation. You can write your own
files ( <xhtml:a href="http://git.mwop.net/?a=tree&amp;p=vimrc&amp;h=5990c978d877f9dcad2a02239ae3af74bcb75ba4&amp;hb=c1a728c96fa593be5c570c78cac5dcb2b7052fd3&amp;f=snippets/php">
I did</xhtml:a>), or use those that come with it. Once you've got some
snippets, you type a word (usually a mnemonic for the operation
you're trying to perform), and it will either just spit up a
template, or optionally provide "prompts" for you to fill in (along
with variable completion!). Basically, I never code accessors and
mutators anymore; snipMate does these for me, with a little
prompting.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.6">Organization</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>I use Vim day-in, day-out, for all sorts of things: mail,
drafting blog posts, drafting presentation outlines, taking meeting
notes, managing my todo list, and more. As such, I try to keep as
much of my "organization" within Vim -- it's just easier.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I've tried a number of tools over the years. For a good 4 or 5
years, my primary tool was <xhtml:a href="http://www.vimoutliner.org/">VimOutliner</xhtml:a>. It provided decent
syntax, decent folding, and reasonable HTML generation from the
outline. However, in recent years, I feel the project had stalled,
and I also found that the way I wanted to use it had changed:
outlining is great, but I often want to use the outline as a
starting point for generating content; task tracking is fine, but I
found, for whatever reason, that the way VimOutliner handled task
status often didn't work well -- either from a tooling or a syntax
standpoint.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>At some point, <xhtml:a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">Travis
Swicegood</xhtml:a> introduced me to <xhtml:a href="http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/">vimwiki</xhtml:a>. This tool provides
a personal wiki <xhtml:em>within</xhtml:em> Vim. This tool allowed me to
organize my notes in an ad-hoc, semi-hierarchical way, link back
and forth between them, and have not only reasonable in-editor
highlighting, but great HTML generation. This allowed me to ditch
VimOutliner for everything but task tracking. Once I made my "wiki"
directory a Git repository, I then received versioning basically
for free (especially with vim-fugitive, which makes it easy for me
to hit <xhtml:code>:Gwrite</xhtml:code> and <xhtml:code>:Gcommit</xhtml:code> when I create
and/or update files).</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Another feature vimwiki provides is a "diary". You access it
using <xhtml:code>&lt;Leader&gt;w&lt;Leader&gt;w</xhtml:code>, which opens up a
new wiki page for the current day (or, if you already opened it
before, re-opens the one created earlier in the day). This is a
really useful tool for taking notes during meetings, or when doing
research, etc.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Couple these features with integrated search (<xhtml:code>:VWS
/pattern/</xhtml:code>), and vimwiki is <xhtml:em>the</xhtml:em> killer productivity
tool in my toolbox.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>At another point, Travis then pointed out another tool: <xhtml:a href="https://github.com/samsonw/vim-task">vim-task</xhtml:a>. This is perhaps
the most dead-simple task tracker I've ever used; each line is a
task, and is either incomplete (starts with a "-"), or complete
(starts with a checkmark). A simple keybinding, which I've mapped
to <xhtml:code>&lt;Leader&gt;m</xhtml:code>, toggles status - and complete
items get highlighted in green and italicized, making you feel good
and giving a good visual queue as to what you've completed.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>At some point, Travis also tossed out the idea that combining
vimwiki with vim-task would be useful -- and I latched onto this
idea. I've now created <xhtml:a href="https://github.com/weierophinney/vimwiki/tree/feature/vim-task">a
fork of vimwiki with vim-task integration</xhtml:a>, which allows me to
keep my tasks and notes in a single place... and, since my wiki is
versioned, my tasks are as well.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.7">Various Oddities</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>As I mentioned at the start of this post, I've been using Vim
for close to a decade. Part of the reason Vim was appealing to me
was due to the fact that it kept me in the "home row" of the
keyboard -- which provides a huge amount of efficency. You don't
have to move to the arrow keys to scroll, no leaving the keyboard
for the mouse, etc. That said, some key combinations are difficult
to reach:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>The placement of the <xhtml:code>&lt;Esc&gt;</xhtml:code> key varies from
keyboard to keyboard, and is rarely in a place that is easy to
reach. On my current keyboard, it's in the top left corner, above
the function keys; it's impossible to reach without moving my hand.
A tip I picked up pretty much when I began using Vim was to map
"jj" to <xhtml:code>&lt;Esc&gt;</xhtml:code>; it's rare to type a "j"
repeatedly in the English language, and it's dead-center on the
home row. This is incredibly efficent.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>I've mapped my Caps Lock key to <xhtml:code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</xhtml:code> on
every system I've owned in the past decade. I never used it, and
it's almst always on the home row. Again, hugely efficient.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Keybindings are great, but there's so many already in use that
it's hard <xhtml:em>not</xhtml:em> to overwrite existing ones. Using the
<xhtml:code>&lt;Leader&gt;</xhtml:code> key to define keybindings has been
great. As examples, I mapped <xhtml:code>&lt;Leader&gt;m</xhtml:code> to toggle
tasks, and <xhtml:code>&lt;Leader&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;</xhtml:code> to invoke
snipMate.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>In Vim, <xhtml:code>&lt;C-m&gt;</xhtml:code> has long been the "make"
binding, and <xhtml:code>&lt;C-l&gt;</xhtml:code> for linters. In languages
like PHP and JavaScript, these often don't make sense. However,
I've bound these in both languages -- in PHP, "make" executes the
current script using the PHP executable, while "lint" runs it
through the PHP linter. In JS, I leave "make" unbound, while "lint"
runs the script through jslint.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I've also added the "php-doc.vim" plugin, and mapped
<xhtml:code>&lt;C-P&gt;</xhtml:code> to create PHP docblocks; the plugin is
context aware, and will create appropriate annotations.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.8">Cloning my repo</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>As noted, I've created a repository for my Vim configuration. If
you want to clone it and explore it, you can do so as follows:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>Browse the repository: <xhtml:a href="http://git.mwop.net/?a=summary&amp;p=vimrc">http://git.mwop.net/?a=summary&amp;p=vimrc</xhtml:a></xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Clone the repo: <xhtml:code>git clone
git://mwop.net/vimrc.git</xhtml:code></xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>Be aware that there a number of git submodules in play (all the
pathogen modules are git submodules). To initialize these, simply
run <xhtml:code>git submodule init</xhtml:code> followed by <xhtml:code>git submodule
update</xhtml:code> after you clone the repository.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.9">Resources</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>I didn't learn all this overnight. As with any toolset, it's
only as good as the amount of time you invest learning it. For me,
my primary resources lately have been:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23vim">#vim hashtag on
Twitter</xhtml:a></xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://vimcasts.org/">VimCasts</xhtml:a> are a fantastic
source of information, provided by Drew Neil. Seriously, these are
<xhtml:strong>completely</xhtml:strong> worth the time spent watching
them.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">Travis Swicegood</xhtml:a>
has tweeted a number of times about interesting things he does with
Vim and Git, and inspired me to write the vim-task syntax for
vimwiki.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:h2 id="toc_1.10">More Tools</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>This post has been on my <xhtml:i>Vim</xhtml:i> toolbox. I've also been usig
a number of other tools lately -- <xhtml:a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</xhtml:a>, <xhtml:a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</xhtml:a> (in particular, git prompts),
<xhtml:a href="http://hotot.org/">Hotot</xhtml:a> (GTK2 + WebKit Twitter
client), and more; I may blog about those in the future -- using
Vim. ;-)</xhtml:p>

on a quest for a "find in project" feature for Vim</xhtml:a>. "Find in
Project" was a feature of Textmate that he'd grown accustomed to
and was having trouble finding an equivalent for.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The funny thing is that Textmate is a newcomer, and, of course,
vim has had such a feature for years. The thing to remember with
vim, of course, is its unix roots; typically if you know the unix
command for doing something, you can find what you need in vim. In
this case, the key is the vimgrep plugin, which ships in the
standard vim distribution.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>There are a variety of resources on vimgrep. The vim
documentation includes a chapter on it, and a quick <xhtml:a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vimgrep">google search</xhtml:a> on the
subject turns up some nice tutorials immediately. If you've ever
used grep, the syntax is very straightforward:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code>vimgrep /{pattern}/[g][j] {file} ...
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:p>The "g" option indicates that all matches for a search will be
returned instead of just one per line, and the "j" option tells vim
<xhtml:em>not</xhtml:em> to jump to the first match automatically. What does
the "g" flag really mean, though, and how are searches
returned?</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Vimgrep returns search results in what's known as a "quickfix"
window, and this is where the vimgrep documentation falls apart...
it doesn't explain what this is, or link to it (which would be a
nice indication that it actually has a separate topic for
this).</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The Quickfix window is a pane that shows a search result per
line. Each line shows the file that matches, the line number, and
the contents of that line:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code>/home/matthew/git/bugapp/application/controllers/helpers/GetForm.php|10| * @var Zend_Loader_PluginLoader
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:p>You can't do much from this window; it simply serves as a visual
indicator of what file you're currently looking at from the list.
However, in the main window, you can start iterating through the
results one at a time, using a subset of the Quickfix commands. As
a quick summary:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:b>:cc</xhtml:b> will move to the next match in the list</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:b>:cn</xhtml:b> will move to the next match in the list</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:b>:cp</xhtml:b> will move to the previous match in the list</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:b>:cr</xhtml:b> will rewind to the first match in the list</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li><xhtml:b>:cla</xhtml:b> will fast forward to the last match in the
list</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>When done, you can simply close the Quickfix window/pane, and
continue working.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I should note that vimgrep <xhtml:em>is</xhtml:em> cross-platform. On
*nix-based systems, it defaults to using the native grep command,
but it also contains an internal (slower) implementation for use on
operating systems that do not provide grep by default. You may also
map the command to alternate implementations if desired.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I personally use this feature most with the <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69">project
plugin</xhtml:a>. Project maps vimgrep to two different commands:
&lt;Leader&gt;g and &lt;Leader&gt;G. The first will grep all files
in the current project at the current level; the second does the
same, but also recurses into subprojects. This is an incredibly
easy way to refactor code, particularly for name changes.</xhtml:p>

      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I use <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</xhtml:a> for all my editing
needs -- TODO lists, email, presentation outlines, coding in any
language... everything. So, I thought I'd start sharing some of my
vim habits and tools with others, particularly those that pertain
to using Vim with PHP.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>Mapping the PHP interpreter and linter to keystrokes</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Probably the most useful thing I've done as a PHP developer is
to add mappings to run the current file through (a) the PHP
interpreter (using Ctrl-M), and (b) the PHP interpreter's linter
(using Ctrl-L). These are accomplished with the following:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="vim" xml:lang="vim">
\" run file with PHP CLI (CTRL-M)
:autocmd FileType php noremap &lt;C-M&gt; :w!&lt;CR&gt;:!$HOME/bin/php %&lt;CR&gt;

\" PHP parser check (CTRL-L)
:autocmd FileType php noremap &lt;C-L&gt; :!$HOME/bin/php -l %&lt;CR&gt;
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
</xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>(I have ~/bin/php as my PHP interpreter, which allows me to run
PHP with a custom config file, as well as to change which PHP
binary I'm using.)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>These two commands allow me to quickly and easily check that my
syntax is okay, as well as to run unit test suites easily.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>Vim Project</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>Next up is the excellent <xhtml:a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69">Project
plugin</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>"Project", at its most basic, allows you to setup a navigation
pane with a list of files related to your project. The files are
typically organized by directory, but the beauty is that the
hierarchy can be defined however it makes sense for your given
project. It also has tools for creating projects based on a given
directory, recursively pulling in files based on filters you
specify. Type ':help project' to get documentation on this after
you install it; <xhtml:code>\C</xhtml:code> will help you create your first
project.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Each project can consist of one or more project folds; these can
be sub projects, or a self-defined hierarchy or grouping of files.
For instance, in my Zend Framework project file, I have "library",
"tests", and "documentation" folds -- "library" points to
"library/Zend/", "tests" points to "tests/", and "documentation"
points to "documentation/manual/en/". Within each, I then have
folds for each subdirectory. Since directories and subprojects are
specified as folds, you can use Vim's native folding mechanisms to
keep only the file of interest visible, which is very handy.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div><xhtml:img src="/uploads/2008-03-22-VimProject.png" alt="Vim Project"/></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>Basically, Project allows vim to act like a minimal IDE. With
the file list on the left, you simply hit enter on a file, and it
loads in the main pane. More fun is when you use the \S command,
which will split the main pane and load the file into the new pane.
This is particularly useful when doing Test Driven Development, as
you can have one pane for the unit test code, and another for the
class file, allowing you to jump back and forth between them. Add
to this the Ctrl-M and Ctrl-L commands I listed earlier, and you're
now also able to quickly and easily check your files for syntax
errors and run tests directly within the Vim window.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div><xhtml:img src="/uploads/2008-03-22-VimUnitTests.png" alt="Vim Project"/></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>There are other commands, too. You can run all files through a
particular script, grep all files in a project, map particular file
types to specific launchers, etc. Combine it with other Vim
functionality, and you have a minimal, yet powerful, IDE at your
disposal that launches in under a second.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>By default, Project stores projects in $HOME/.vimprojects. I
find that I don't necessarily want all my projects at any given
time, so I've created a $HOME/.projects/ directory that has a
project entry for each project -- I simply save the contents of a
project fold to files under this tree. I can then perform <xhtml:code>:r
~/.projects/&lt;projectname&gt;</xhtml:code> to read in a given project
when I want to work on it. This helps me keep my workspace
uncluttered, and also helps me focus on a given project at a
time.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h3>Ctags</xhtml:h3>
<xhtml:p>I've <xhtml:a href="/matthew/archives/134-exuberant-ctags-with-PHP-in-Vim.html">covered
ctags</xhtml:a> elsewhere, so I won't cover them here, but with ctags
defined, I get tab completion for most classes and methods (and Vim
takes care of tab-completion for class members in the current class
file), as well as the ability to quickly and easily open class
files for classes I've tagged -- which is useful when you want to
see what methods are available and how they work.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:hr/>
<xhtml:p>I'll try and cover other vim techniques I use in upcoming blog
entries. Those listed in here, though, have greatly increased my
productivity, and are things I use daily.</xhtml:p>

    <content xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" type="xhtml">
      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>One reason I've heard PHP developers use for adopting an IDE
when developing is the ability to click on a class or function name
and jump to the declaration. Sounds like magic, and it's definitely
something I've desired.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>One way I get around it is by adopting PEAR coding standards for
naming my classes. Since they define a one-to-one mapping of class
name to the file system (substitute the underscore character ('_')
with the directory separator), I can usually very quickly and
easily open a class file, particularly if I start in the base
directory of the project install.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Today, however, I found <xhtml:a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net">exuberant ctags</xhtml:a>, a library which
can be used to generate an index file mapping language objects to
source files and the line in the source file where they are
declared. Contrary to its name, it's not just for the C language;
it currently supports 33 different programming languages, including
PHP.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I decided to try it out on the Zend Framework core library
today. At first run, it was pretty useful. However, it was only
mapping classes, and, in addition, only those defined with the
single word 'class' -- abstract classes and interfaces were
entirely left out. So, I looked into the documentation to see if I
could change the behaviour.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>And, being a Unix program, of course I could. First off, you can
add functions to the items it indexes with a simple flag.
Additionally, you can use POSIX regular expressions to refine what
it searches.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I whipped up the following script to create my tags index:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="bash" xml:lang="bash">
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/framework/library
exec ctags-exuberant -f ~/.vim/mytags/framework \
-h \".php\" -R \
--exclude=\"\.svn\" \
--totals=yes \
--tag-relative=yes \
--PHP-kinds=+cf \
--regex-PHP='/abstract class ([^ ]*)/\1/c/' \
--regex-PHP='/interface ([^ ]*)/\1/c/' \
--regex-PHP='/(public |static |abstract |protected |private )+function ([^ (]*)/\2/f/'
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>This script creates the tag index in the file
<xhtml:kbd>$HOME/.vim/mytags/framework</xhtml:kbd>. It scans for PHP files
recursively through the tree, excluding any files found in a
<xhtml:kbd>.svn</xhtml:kbd> directory (I'm using a checkout from the subversion
repository). The file paths in the index are created relative to
the tags file; this was important, because if this wasn't provided,
vim was unable to jump to the file, as it couldn't find it.
<xhtml:kbd>--PHP-kinds=+cf</xhtml:kbd> tells it to index classes and functions.
Next, I've got three regular expressions. The first tells it to
match classes beginning with 'abstract class' as classes. The
second tells it to match interfaces as classes. The last is so that
PHP 5 methods, which begin with a visibility operator, to be
matched as functions.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Once the index file is generated (it takes less than a second),
all you need to do in vim is tell it to load it: <xhtml:kbd>:set
tags=~/.vim/mytags/framework</xhtml:kbd>. At this point, you can do all
sorts of fun stuff. Place the cursor on a class name or method
name, anywhere in it, and hit <xhtml:kbd>Ctrl-]</xhtml:kbd>, and you'll jump to
the file and line of its declaration; <xhtml:kbd>Ctrl-T</xhtml:kbd> then takes
you back. If you change the invocation to <xhtml:kbd>Ctrl-W ]</xhtml:kbd>, it
will split the current window and open the declaration in the new
pane. (If you're familiar with how help works with Vim, this should
seem pretty familiar.)</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>One more reason to stick with Vim for your PHP editing needs.
:-)</xhtml:p>
