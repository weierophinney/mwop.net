    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/132-svnexternals.html">svn:externals</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was recently working with someone who was using Zend Framework in their
    project. To keep things stable and releasable, he was doing an export of
    framework into his repository and checking it in. Since files change so much
    in the ZF project currently, instead of doing an rsync from a checkout into
    his own repository, he decided instead to delete the directory from the
    repository and re-add it everytime he was updating framework.
</p>
<p>
    This seemed really inefficient to me, especially considering that it made it
    incredibly difficult to merge changes from his development branch into his
    production branch (deleting and re-adding directories breaks the merge
    process considerably). I knew there had to be a better way.
</p>
<p>
    I'd heard of the svn:externals property before, but never really played with
    it. As it turns out, it exists for just this very type of situation. The
    problem is that the 
    <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.advanced.externals">documentation of svn:externals</a> 
    in the SVN book doesn't indicate at all how the property should be set, and
    most howto's I've read omit one or more very important details. I finally
    figured things out through some trial and error of my own, so I'm going to
    share the process so others hopefully can learn from the experience as well.
</p>
<p>
    It's actually pretty easy. This assumes that your project layout looks
    something like this:
</p>
<pre>
project/
    branch/
        production/
    tag/
    trunk/
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>In the top of your project trunk, execute the following:
<pre>
svn propedit svn:externals .
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>This will open an editor session. In the file opened by your editor,
    each line indicates a different external svn repo to pull. The first segment
    of the line is the directory where you want the pull to exist. The last
    segment is the svn repo URL to pull. You can have an optional middle
    argument indicating the revision to use. Some examples:
    <ul>
        <li>Pull framework repo from head:
<pre>
framework http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Pull framework repo from revision 2616:
<pre>
framework -r2616 http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk
</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>After saving and exiting, update the repo:
<pre>
svn up
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Commit changes:
<pre>
svn commit
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    One thing to note: any directory you specify for an svn:externals checkout
    should <b>not</b> already exist in your repository. If it does, you will get
    an error like the following:
</p>
<pre>
svn: Working copy 'sharedproject' locked
svn: run 'svn cleanup' to remove locks
</pre>
<p>
    I show using revisions above; you could also pin to tags by simply checkout
    the external repository from a given tag. Either way works well.
</p>
<p>
    Then, when moving from one branch to another, or from the trunk to a branch,
    you simply set a different svn:externals for each branch. For instance, your
    current production might check from one particular revision, but your trunk
    might simply track head; you then simply determine what the current revision
    being used is on your trunk, and update svn:externals in your production
    branch when you're ready to push changes in.
</p>
<p>
    Hope this helps some of you out there!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been playing with <a href="http://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> a lot of
    late, particularly with 
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">framework development</a>.
    One thing that's always hard to determine is how well your code is exercised
    -- basically, how much of the code is tested in the unit tests?
</p>
<p>
    In PHPUnit 3, you can now generate code coverage reports using 
    <a href="http://xdebug.org">XDebug</a>, and the usage is very simple:
</p>
<pre>
matthew@localhost:~/dev/zend/framework-svn/tests$ phpunit --report ~/tmp/report AllTests
</pre>
<p>
    The above command creates a coverage report directory 'report' under my tmp
    directory. You can then browse through the reports in a web browser and
    visually see which lines of code were executed during tests, and which were
    not, as well as a synopsis showing the percentage of coverage for any given
    file or directory -- useful stuff indeed!
</p>
<p>
    So, what's the problem? Getting XDebug running.
</p>
<p>
    The executive summary:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enable the extension using <kbd>zend_extension =
        /full/path/to/xdebug.so</kbd>, not as <kbd>extension =
        xdebug.so</kbd>, in your php.ini</li>
    <li>Use the setting <kbd>xdebug.default_enable = Off</kbd> in your
    php.ini.</li>
    <li>If compiling using pecl or pear, make sure it compiles against the
    correct PHP; if not, hand compile it using:
    <pre>
$ /path/to/phpize
$ ./configure --with-php-config=/path/to/php-config
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Several months ago, <a href="http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/">Andi</a>
    asked me to take the role of lead developer on a refactoring of the 
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> MVC components. I
    agreed, though somewhat reluctantly; I already maintain 
    <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">another MVC library</a>, and wasn't
    sure how well I could fill the shoes of people like my friends 
    <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com">Mike</a>, who had done the initial
    development on the controller classes, and 
    <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul</a>, who provided Zend_View.
</p>
<p>
    The experience has been incredibly rewarding, however, and I've had the
    chance to pick the brains of and work with some top-notch developers in the
    process. In the next week or so, we'll be releasing version 0.6.0 of the
    framework, and it will include much of my work in the MVC components as part
    of the core distribution. A big thanks to all those who have contributed
    opinions, design help, code, tests, and documentation; another thank you
    goes to Andi for trusting and supporting me in this endeavor.
</p>
<p>
    So, what are the changes? Read on to find out...

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    As <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/archives/53">Mike already noted,</a>
    he and I are presenting a session on "Best Practices of PHP Development" at
    <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/speakers_list.php#day1">this year's Zend Conference and Expo</a>.
    It has been my fortunate experience to work with Mike in the past, and, as
    he noted, we had so much fun presenting during last year's conference, we
    thought we'd do it again.
</p>
<p>
    The session is a pre-conference tutorial session, running for 3 hours on
    Monday morning, 30 October 2006.  Currently, we're shaping up the session
    into the following subject areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Programming Practices</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding Standards</li>
            <li>Test Driven Development and Unit Testing</li>
            <li>Project Documentation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Tools and Processes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Configuration Management (SCM)</li>
            <li>Collaboration tips and tools</li>
            <li>Deployment</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Emphasis is going to be on working in teams, particularly those operating in
    geographically diverse areas.  With roughly 30 minute blocks per topic,
    we've certainly got plenty to cover!
</p>
<p>
    If you're coming to the conference, we look forward to seeing you in our
    session!

    I've been working on Zend_XmlRpc_Server for some months now. In the past
    couple weeks, I've refactored it to push the class/function reflection into
    Zend_Server_Reflection, and, in doing so, noted that there were further
    areas for refactoring into additional helper classes. Currently, it now has
    classes for the Request, Response, and Faults, and all actual XML wrangling
    is done in those, making the server basically XML-agnostic.

    become very familiar with PHP 5's Reflection API, and am coming to love it.
</p>
<p>
    When I first read about the Reflection API in a pre-PHP 5 changelog, my
    initial reaction was, "who cares?" I simply failed to see how it was a
    useful addition to the language. Having done some projects recently that
    needed to know something about the classes they are using, I now understand
    when and how it can be used. It shines when you need to work with classes
    that may not be defined when you write your code -- any code that dispatches
    to other classes, basically.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I may work at <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a>, but I've never been a
    fan of IDEs. They simply don't suit my programming style. I can usually keep
    track of file locations in my head pretty easily, and what I really need is
    a blank slate on which I can write, and one that doesn't consume resource
    that can better be used running web servers and other programs. Syntax
    highlighting, good indentation -- these are important, but you can get these
    from good, minimal text editors very easily. 
    <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim is my editor of choice</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I will admit, though, that one area where I have had IDE-envy is the area of
    code completion. I often find myself doing quick lookups to php.net or
    perldoc to determine the order of arguments to a function or method call,
    or checking for the expected return value. Most of the time, this doesn't
    take much time, however, so I just live with it.
</p>
<p>
    Today, however, cruising through the blogosphere, I came across 
    <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/09/visual-walk-through-of-couple-of-new.html">an article showcasing some new features of Vim 7.0</a>, 
    and discovered Vim 7's code completion.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, while in insert mode, you can type &lt;C-x&gt; &lt;C-o&gt; to
    have vim attempt to autocomplete the current keyword. If more than one
    possibility exists, it shows a dropdown, and you can use your arrow keys to
    highlight the keyword that you wish to use.
</p>
<p>
    But it gets better! Not only does it do this kind of autocompletion, but it
    also opens a small 'scratch preview' pane showing the function/method
    signature -- i.e., the expected arguments and return value!
</p>
<p>
    I thought I had little need for IDEs before... now I have even less! Bram
    and the rest of the Vim team, my hat's off to you for more fine work!

    I decided to run some benchmarks.
</p>
<p>
    &lt;rant&gt;Writing benchmarks is easy. Yet I see a lot of blog entries and
    mailing list postings asking, "Which is faster?" My first thought is always,
    "Why didn't they test and find out?" If I ever have a question about how
    something will work, I open up a temporary file, start coding, and run the
    code. It's the easiest way to learn. Also, it teaches you to break things
    into manageable, testable chunks, and this code often forms the basis for a
    unit test later.&lt;/rant&gt;
</p>
<p>
    Back to benchmarking. Scott asks, "Is there a real difference between
    call_user_func versus call_user_func_array and the variable function syntax
    i.e. $function_name()?"
</p>
<p>
    The short answer: absolutely. The long answer? Read on.

    recent announcement of the 1.0 release, as well as to combat some rampant
    issues with trackback spam.
</p>
<p>
    I've been very happy with Serendipity so far; it just runs, and the default
    install gives just what you need to get a blog up and running, and nothing
    more; any extra functionality comes via plugins which you, the blogger, get
    to decide upon.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, it's incredibly easy to upgrade. Unpack the tarball, rsync
    it over your existing install (I rsync it, because I don't use 'serendipity'
    as my directory name), visit the admin, boom, you're done. I've upgraded
    several times, and never lost data, nor configuration settings. 
</p>
<p>
    My primary reason for the upgrade was, as noted earlier, to combat trackback
    spam. As of this morning, I had 15,000 pending trackbacks, none of which
    appeared to be valid (if any of them were, and you're not seeing yours, I'm
    very sorry; I deleted them <em>en masse</em>). These had accumulated in <em>less than
    a month</em> -- that's an average of about one every 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    Since upgrading, and using the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>
    service, I've received not a single spam trackback. Needless to say, I'm
    happy I performed the upgrade!
</p>
<p>
    If you're a Serendipity user, and haven't upgraded to 1.0.0 yet (or one of
    it's reportedly very stable release candidates), do it today -- you have
    nothing to lose, and a lot of lost time to gain!
