    <div class="entry body"><p>
    <a href="http://jansch.nl/">Ivo</a> already pointed this out, but I want to
    point it out again: Boy Baukema writes 
    <a href="http://www.ibuildings.nl/blog/archives/541-Backward-compatibility,-bane-of-the-developer.html">a very nice entry regarding backwards compatibility</a>
    on the ibuildings.nl corporate blog.
</p>

<p>
    Backwards compatibility (BC) is a tricky thing to support, even when you
    strive hard to, as Boy puts it, "think hard about your API" prior to
    release. Somebody will always come along and point out ways it could have
    been done better or ways it could be improved. I've had to wrestle with
    these issues a ton since joining the Zend Framework team, and while it often
    feels like the wrong thing to do to tell somebody, "too little, too late"
    when they have genuinely good feedback for you, its often in the best
    interest of the many users already using a component.
</p>

<p>
    I had the pleasure of meeting Boy last year when visiting the ibuildings.nl
    offices, and he's got a good head on his shoulders. He does a nice job
    outlining the issues and a number of approaches to BC; if you develop a
    project for public consumption, you should definitely head over and read
    what he has to say.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In an effort to debug issues on a cluster, I was trying to determine which
    machine on the cluster was causing the issue. My idea was that I could
    insert a header token identifying the server.
</p>

<p>
    My first idea was to add the directive 'Header add X-Server-Ip
    "%{SERVER_ADDR}e" in my httpd.conf. However, due to the nature of our load
    balancer, Apache was somehow resolving this to the load balancer IP address
    on all machines of the cluster -- which was really, really not useful.
</p>

<p>
    I finally stumbled on a good solution, however: you can set environment
    variables in apachectl, and then pass them into the Apache environment using
    the PassEnv directive from mod_env; once that's done, you can use the
    environment variable anywhere.
</p>

<p>
    In my apachectl, I added the line "export HOSTNAME=`hostname`". Then, in my
    httpd.conf, I added first the line "PassEnv HOSTNAME", followed by the
    directive 'Header add X-Server-Name "%{HOSTNAME}e"'. Voila! I now had the
    hostname in the header, which gave me the information I needed for
    debugging.

    2007 was a busy year, both personally and professionally. I won't go into
    the personal too much, because, well, it's personal, and some of the details

</p>

<p>
    Here's the short version:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>One trip to Belgium and The Netherlands.</li>
    <li>Two trips to Israel.</li>
    <li>Two trips to Atlanta, GA (not counting the return trip from Europe, when
    I was stranded for a day due to storms in the Northeast).</li>
    <li>Three different user groups attended, with three presentations.</li>
    <li>One major Zend Framework release</li>
    <li>One PEAR release.</li>
    <li>One podcast.</li>
    <li>One webinar.</li>
    <li>One book published.</li>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I ran into an issue recently in testing a site where PDO_SQLITE was claiming
    that it could not read my PDO database files. The only recent change I'd had
    was that I'd installed a new version of PHP, and hence a new version of
    PDO_SQLITE. Searching the web (we're not supposed to say <em>googling</em>
    or <em>googled</em> anymore, remember ;-)), I found that the issue was that
    the version of sqlite compiled into my PHP install was not compatible with
    the version I used to create the databases in the first place. Never mind
    that they're only a micro version or two different.
</p>

<p>
    So, I was left with a conundrum: I needed to create files compatible with my
    PDO_SQLITE install, but my CLI sqlite tool was incompatible. And if I used
    PDO_SQLITE to create the db file, I'd lose my data, right?
</p>

<p>
    Wrong. And here's what you can do should you find yourself in the same
    situation sometime.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been considering for a good six months trying to organize a PHP Users
    Group for the Burlington, VT, area. When we first moved to Vermont, I was
    surprised (and excited) by the number of PHP shops (which at the time I saw
    as job potential, as I was looking for work), and actually walked my resume
    around to a half-dozen or so. The area has a ton of PHP developers, and it
    only makes sense to have a UG where we can exchange tips and tricks of the
    trade.
</p>

<p>
    Then, about six weeks ago, I mentioned this to my friend Rob. He did what I
    should have done all along, and googled for an existing group -- and found
    one!
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP">Burlington, VT PHP Users Group</a>
    has been around since November of 2005 on Google Groups, but we're having
    our inaugural meeting this coming Wednesday, 5 December 2007. I'll be
    speaking at this first meeting on Zend Framework's MVC components
</p>

<p>
    If you're in the Burlington area this Wednesday, you should stop by. For
    more details, 
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP/web/meeting-2007-12-05">visit the event page</a>,

    <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon '07</a> is finally over, the dust
    has settled, and I finally find myself with some time alone... practically
    the first I've had since Sunday. The week was fantastic, and I had many good
    conversations and brainstorming sessions. Oh, and I ended up giving three
    different sessions, so it's time for links to slides and materials:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-BestPractices.odp">Best Practices of PHP Development</a>. 
        <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian</a>, 
        <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike</a>, and I presented a full-day
        tutorial on PHP development best practices, focussing primarily on
        testing and testing strategies, but also covering coding standards,
        usage of SCM tools, and deployment. There were a ton of questions from
        the attendees, and Sebastian even whipped out some extra slides at the
        end showing new and little-known features of PHPUnit. Basically, reading
        the slides won't really indicate what we covered, but is more of a
        general outline. It was an honor and pleasure to work with Sebastian and
        Mike on this, and I hope we can do it again in the future some time.
    </li>

    <li><a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-MVC.ppt">Zend Framework MVC Quick Start</a>.
        This was basically the same session I did in my <a href="http://www.zend.com/webinar">webinar</a>
        a couple weeks ago, with a few corrections and a small demonstration.
        Cal put me on directly following <a href="http://terrychay.com/blog">Terry Chay</a>,
        in the largest of the four session rooms -- the one where all the
        keynotes occurred -- talk about intimidating! Amazingly, the session was
        really well attended -- others I talked to estimate between 100 and 150
        people showed up. The most amazing part, though, was that when I asked
        how many people knew what 'MVC' was, I don't think there was a single
        person who didn't raise their hand -- definitely a sign of how well
        accepted the pattern now is in PHP.
    </li>

    <li><a href="/uploads/2007-ZendCon-AjaxPresentation.odp">AJAX-Enabling Your Zend Framework Controllers</a>.
        I did this talk for the <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon">Unconference</a>,
        mainly because its a topic I've been interested in and wanted to
        present. In it, I detailed how to ajax-enable an application through
        some easy tricks with Action and View Helpers and using JS to decorate
        your existing application. The reference app I used was a pastebin, and
        I've got code for both <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a> and 
        <a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</a> flavors available:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/uploads/PastebinDojo.tar.gz">Dojo pastebin</a></li>
            <li><a href="/uploads/PastebinPrototype.tar.gz">Prototype pastebin</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The two highlight keynote speakers, for me, were definitely 
    <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> and
    <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>. Neither spoke about PHP,
    but both spoke about topics that PHP developers should take to heart.
    Perhaps I'll elaborate on those in another post.
</p>

<p>
    Another bonus for me was the number of old and new friends alike I got to
    see -- I had many good conversations with Paul M. Jones, Nate Abele, Ivo
    Jansch, and Ralph Schindler, and opportunities to finally meet fellow
    co-author Lig Turmelle, Ben Ramsey, Chris Shifflet (dude, we've been to four
    conferences together, and never yet met!), and many, many others. I was also
    overwhelmed by the number of Zend Framework users who sought me out either
    to ask me questions or simply thank me and the others on the team for the
    project; I'm deeply honored that I can work on a project that affects so
    many developers.

<p>
    And now for some down time to recuperate...

    I don't know why I haven't blogged this sooner, but, yes, I'll be speaking
    once again at <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon:</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.zend.com.com" ><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/zendcon/ZendCon07_SpeakerBadge.gif" border="0"></a></p>

<p>
    I'll be presenting a number of times:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>On Monday, I join <a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de/">Sebastian Bergmann</a> 
        and <a href="http://naberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</a> in a full-day
        tutorial session on PHP Development Best Practices and Unit Testing.
        This expands on what Mike and I did last year, and will more heavily
        emphasize the role of testing in the development process -- arguably the
        most important best practice you can adopt.</li>
    <li>On Tuesday monrning, I'll present a Zend Framework MVC Quick Start. This
        talk is based on a <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/144-Zend-Framework-MVC-Webinar-posted.html">webinar</a> 
        I recently gave for Zend, and covers the various pieces of the MVC layer
        in Zend Framework.
    </li>
    <li>Tuesday evening, I'll present an <a href="http://zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon">Unconference</a>
        session on Ajax-enabling your Zend Framework controllers. I don't know
        yet if I'll need the whole hour, but I can probably fill it up with some
        examples of decorating your apps with AJAX.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Looking forward to seeing you all there!
