    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/41-Cgiapp-Roadmap.html">Cgiapp Roadmap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a few people contact me indicating interest in Cgiapp, and I've
    noticed a number of subscribers to the freshmeat project I've setup. In
    addition, we're using the library extensively at the <a href="http://www.garden.org">National Gardening Association</a> in
    developing our new site (the current site is using a mixture of ASP and
    Tango, with several newer applications using PHP). I've also been monitoring
    the CGI::Application mailing list. As a result of all this activity, I've
    decided I need to develop a roadmap for Cgiapp.
</p>
<p>Currently, planned changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Version 1.x series:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a Smarty registration for stripslashes (the Smarty
            "function" call will be sslashes).</li>
            <li>param() bugfix: currently, calling param() with no arguments
            simply gives you a list of parameters registered with the method,
            but not their values; this will be fixed.</li>
            <li>error_mode() method. The CGI::Application ML brought up and
            implemented the idea of an error_mode() method to register
            an error_mode with the object (similar to run_modes()). While
            non-essential, it would offer a standard, built-in hook for error
            handling.</li>
            <li>$PATH_INFO traversing. Again, on the CGI::App ML, a request was
            brought up for built-in support for using $PATH_INFO to determine
            the run mode. Basically, you would pass a parameter indicating which
            location in the $PATH_INFO string holds the run mode.</li>
            <li>DocBook tutorials. I feel that too much information is given in
            the class-level documentation, and that usage tutorials need to be
            written. Since I'm documenting with PhpDoc and targetting PEAR,
            moving tutorials into DocBook is a logical step.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Version 2.x series:</b><br>
        Yes, a Cgiapp2 is in the future. There are a few changes that are either
        necessitating (a) PHP5, or (b) API changes. In keeping with PEAR
        guidelines, I'll rename the module Cgiapp2 so as not to break
        applications designed for Cgiapp.<br><br>
        Changes expected include:
        <ul>
            <li>Inherit from PEAR. This will allow for some built in error
            handling, among other things. I suspect that this will tie in with
            the error_mode(), and may also deprecate croak() and carp().</li>
            <li>Changes to tmpl_path() and load_tmpl(). In the perl version, you
            would instantiate a template using load_tmpl(), assign your
            variables to it, and then do your fetch() on it. So, this:
                <pre>
$this->tmpl_assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
                </pre>
            Becomes this:
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl();
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch('template.html');
                </pre>
            OR
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch();
                </pre>
            (Both examples assume use of Smarty.) I want to revert to
            this behaviour for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Portability with perl. This is one area in which the PHP
                    and perl versions differ greatly; going to the perl way
                    makes porting classes between the two languages
                    simpler.</li>
                    <li>Decoupling. The current set of template methods create
                    an object as a parameter of the application object - which
                    is fine, unless the template object instantiator returns an
                    object of a different kind.</li>
                </ul>
            Cons:
                <ul>
                     <li>Smarty can use the same object to fill multiple
                     templates, and the current methods make use of this. By
                     assigning the template object locally to each method, this
                     could be lost.<br><br>
                     HOWEVER... an easy work-around would be for load_tmpl() to
                     create the object and store it an a parameter; subsequent
                     calls would return the same object reference. The
                     difficulty then would be if load_tmpl() assumed a template
                     name would be passed.  However, even in CGI::App, you
                     decide on a template engine and design for that engine;
                     there is never an assumption that template engines should
                     be swappable.</li>
                     <li>Existing Cgiapp1 applications would need to be
                     rewritten.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Plugin Architecture:</b>
                The CGI::App ML has produced a ::Plugin namespace that utilizes
                a common plugin architecture. The way it is done in perl is
                through some magic of namespaces and export routines... both of
                which are, notably, missing from PHP.<br><br>
                However, I think I may know a workaround for this, if I use
                PHP5: the magic __call() overloader method.<br><br>
                My idea is to have plugin classes register methods that should
                be accessible by a Cgiapp-based class a special key in the
                $_GLOBALS array.  Then, the __call() method would check the
                key for registered methods; if one is found matching a method
                requested, that method is called (using call_user_func()), with
                the Cgiapp-based object reference as the first reference. Voila!
                instant plugins!<br><br>
                Why do this? A library of 'standard' plugins could then be
                created, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A form validation plugin</li>
                    <li>Alternate template engines as plugins (instead of
                    overriding the tmpl_* methods)</li>
                    <li>An authorization plugin</li>
                </ul>
                Since the 'exported' methods would have access to the Cgiapp
                object, they could even register objects or parameters with it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After working on some OO classes yesterday for an application backend I'm
    developing for work, I decided I needed to create a <tt>BREAD</tt> class to
    make this simpler. You know,
    <b>B</b>rowse-<b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>dit-<b>A</b>dd-<b>D</b>elete.
</p>
<p>
    At first, I figured I'd build off of what I'd done yesterday. But then I got
    to thinking (ah, thinking, my curse). I ran into the <tt>BREAD</tt> concept
    originally when investigating <tt>CGI::Application</tt>; a number of
    individuals had developed <tt>CGI::Apps</tt> that provided this
    functionality. I'd discarded them usually because they provided more
    functionality than I needed or because they introduced more complexity than
    I was willing to tackle right then.
</p>
<p>
    But once my thoughts had gone to <tt>BREAD</tt> and <tt>CGI::App</tt>, I
    started thinking how nice it would be to have <tt>CGI::Application</tt> for
    PHP. And then I thought, why not? What prevents me from porting it? I have
    the source...
</p>
<p>
    So, today I stayed home with Maeve, who, on the tail end of an illness,
    evidently ran herself down when at daycare yesterday, and stayed home
    sleeping most of the day. So, while she was resting, I sat down with a
    printout of the non-POD code of <tt>CGI::App</tt> and hammered out what I
    needed to do. Then, when she fell asleep for a nap, I typed it all out and
    started testing. And, I'm proud to say, it works. For an example, visit <a href="http://dev.weierophinney.net/cgiapp/test.php">my development
        site</a> to see a very simple, templated application in action.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was lamenting at work the other day that now that I've discovered OO and
    templating with PHP, the only major feature missing for me is a way to
    easily document my programs. I'm a big fan of perl's POD, and use it fairly
    extensively, even for simple scripts -- it's a way to provide a quick manual
    without needing to worry too much about how to format it.
</p>
<p>
    So, it hit me on the way home Friday night: what prevents me from using POD
    in multiline comments of PHP scripts? I thought I'd give it a try when I got
    home.
</p>
<p>
    First I googled for 'POD for PHP', and found a link to perlmongers where
    somebody recounted seeing that exact thing done, and how nicely it worked.
</p>
<p>
    Then I tried it.. and it indeed worked. So, basically, I've got all the
    tools I love from perl in PHP, one of which is borrowed directly from the
    language!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/35-Scrap-that.-Were-gonna-use-PHP.html">Scrap that. We&#039;re gonna&#039; use PHP</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been researching and coding for a couple months now with the decision
    that I'd rewrite the family website/portal using mod_perl with
    CGI::Application. I still like the idea, but a couple things recently have
    made me rethink it.
</p>
<p>
    For starters, the perl DBI is a bit of a pain to program. At work, I've
    become very accustomed to using PEAR's DB library, and while it's in many
    ways derived from perl's DBI, it's much simpler to use. 
</p>
<p>
    Then there's the whole HTML::Template debacle. There's several ways in which
    to write the templates, but they don't all work in all situations, and, it
    seems they're a bit limited. We've started using PHP's Smarty at work, and
    it's much more intuitive, a wee bit more consistent, and almost infinitely
    more extendable. I could go the Template::Toolkit route for perl, but that's
    almost like learning another whole language.
</p>
<p>
    Then, there's the way objects work in perl versus PHP. I've discovered
    that PHP objects are very easy and very extendable. I wouldn't have found
    them half as easy, however, if I hadn't already been doing object oriented
    programming in perl. One major difference, however, is how easy it is to
    create new attributes on the fly, and the syntax is much easier and cleaner.
</p>
<p>
    Add to that the fact that if you want to dynamically require modules in
    perl, you have to go through some significant, often unsurmountable, hoops.
    So you can't easily have dynamic objects of dynamically defined classes. In
    PHP, though, you can require_once or include_once at any time without even
    thinking.
</p>
<p>
    The final straw, however, was when I did my first OO application in PHP this
    past week. I hammered it out in a matter of an hour or so. Then I rewrote it
    to incorporate Smarty in around an hour. And it all worked easily. Then I
    wrote a form-handling libary in just over two hours that worked immediately
    -- and made it possible for me to write a several screen application in a
    matter of an hour, complete with form, form validation, and database calls.
    Doing the same with CGI::Application took me hours, if not days.
</p>
<p>
    So, my idea is this: port CGI::Application to PHP. I <em>love</em> the
    concept of CGI::App -- it's exactly how I want to program, and I think it's
    solid. However, by porting it to PHP, I automatically have session and
    cookie support, and database support is only a few lines of code away when I
    use PEAR; I'll add Smarty as the template toolkit of choice, but make it
    easy to override the template methods to utilize . I get a nice MVC-style
    application template, but one that makes developing quickie applications
    truly a snap.
</p>
<p>
    This falls under the "right-tool-for-the-job" category; perl, while a
    wonderful language, and with a large tradition as a CGI language, was not
    developed <em>for the web</em> as PHP was. PHP just makes more sense in this
    instance. And I won't be abandoning perl by any stretch; I still use it
    daily at work and at home for solving any number of tasks from automated
    backups to checking server availability to keeping my ethernet connection
    alive. But I have real strengths as a PHP developer, and it would be a shame
    not to use those strengths with our home website.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    The CGI::Application::ValidateRM module utilizes HTML::FillInForm to fill in
    values in the form if portions did not pass validation. Basically, it
    utilizes HTML::Parser to go through and find the elements and match them to
    values. It's used because the assumption is that you've built your form into
    an HTML::Template, and that way you don't need to put in program logic into
    the form.
</p>
<p>
    Seems another good candidate for using FillInForm would be to populate a

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've used HTML::Template a little, mainly in the Secret Santa project I did
    this past Christmas for my wife's family. One thing I disliked was using the
    normal syntax: &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=IMAGE_SRC&gt; -- it made looking at it
    difficult (it wasn't always easy to tell what was an HTML tag, what was
    plain text, and what was HTML::Template stuff), and it made it impossible to
    validate my pages before they had data.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, there's an alternate syntax: wrap the syntax in HTML comments:
    &lt;!-- TMPL_VAR NAME=IMAGE_SRC --&gt; does the job. It uses more
    characters, true, but it gets highlighted different than HTML tags, as well,
    and that's worth a lot.
</p>
<p>
    And why do I have to say "NAME=" every time? That gets annoying. As it turns
    out, I can simply say: &lt;!-- TMPL_VAR IMAGE_SRC --&gt;, and that, too will
    get the job done.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, what about those times when I want to define a template, but have
    it broken into parts, too? Basically, I want HTML::Template to behave a
    little like SSI. No worries; there's a TMPL_INCLUDE tag that can do this:
    &lt;!-- TMPL_INCLUDE NAME="filename.tmpl" --&gt;.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been reading a lot of posts lately on the CGI::App mailing list about
    using CGI::Application::ValidateRM (RM == Run Mode); I finally went and
    checked it out.
</p>
    CGI::App::ValRM uses Data::FormValidator in order to do its magic.
    Interestingly, D::FV is built much like how I've buit our formHandlers
    library at work -- you specify a list of required fields, and a list of
    fields that need to be validated against criteria, then provide the
    criteria. It goes exactly how I would have done our libraries had we been
    working in perl -- supplying the constraint as a regexp or anonymous sub in
    a hashref for the field.

<p>
    Anyways, it looks like the combination of CGI::App::ValRM with CGI::App
    could greatly simplify any form validations I need to do on the site, which
    will in turn make me very happy!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I had some success last night with the My::Portal CGI::Application
    superclass I'm building -- I actually got it working with CGI::Wiki::Simple
    (after I debugged the latter to fix some delegation issues!). Now that I
    know the "proof-of-concept" works, I'm ready to start in on some other
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    The first issue is: how can I specify different directories for different
    applications to search for templates, while retaining the default directory
    so that the superclass can build the final page? I <em>could</em> always
    simply keep all templates in a single directory and simply prefix them, but
    that seems inelegant, somehow. I'll need to explore how HTML::Template
    integration works with CGI::App.
</p>
<p>
    Second, and closely related: how do I want it to look, in the end? I could
    see keeping the design we have -- it's clean, simple, and yet somehow
    functionally elegant. Okay, I'm exaggerating -- it's your standard
    three-column with header and footer. But it goes with the idea of blocks of
    content. I need to think about that.
</p>
<p>
    I saw a design idea for a WikiWikiWeb today, though, that totally changed my
    ideas of how a Wiki should look. I hadn't been to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> for some time,
    but a Google link to Gaston Julia showed up on Slashdot as it shut down a
    site in Australia, and so I visited it. I <em>like</em> the new design -- it
    separates out the common links needed into a nice left menu, and puts
    a subset of that at the top and bottom of the main column as well, using
    nice borders to visually separate things. I much prefer it to PhpWiki's
    default style, as well as to anything else I've really seen so far relating
    to Wiki layout.

    I've been struggling with how to use modules at runtime instead of compile
    time (I even wrote about this once before). I finally figured it out:
</p>
<pre>my $module = "ROX::Filer";
eval "use $module";
die "couldn't load module : $!n" if ($@);
</pre>
<p>
    Now I just need to figure out how to create objects from dynamic module
    names...!
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update:</b> Creating objects from dynamic names is as easy as dynamically
    loading the module at run-time:
</p>
<pre>my $obj = $module->new();
