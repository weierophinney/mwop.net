    This is the fourth in a series of eight posts detailing tips on deploying
    to Zend Server. <a href="/blog/2014-09-02-zend-server-deployment-part-3.html">The previous post in the series</a>
    detailed a trick I learned about when to execute a <kbd>chmod</kbd> statement
    during deployment.
</p>

<p>
    Today, I'm sharing a tip about securing your Job Queue job scripts.
</p><h2>Tip 4: Secure your job scripts</h2>

<p>
    In the <a href="/blog/2014-08-28-zend-server-deployment-part-2.html">second tip</a>,
    I detailed <em>when</em> to register job scripts, but not how to write them.
    As it turns out, there's one very important facet to consider when writing 
    job scripts: security.
</p>

<p>
    One issue with Job Queue is that jobs are triggered... via the web. This 
    means that they are exposed via the web, which makes them potential attack 
    vectors. However, there's a simple trick to prevent access other than from Job 
    Queue; add this at the top of your job scripts:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
if (! ZendJobQueue::getCurrentJobId()) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    While the jobs are invoked via HTTP, Zend Server has ways of tracking whether
    or not they are being executed in the context of Job Queue, and for which job.
    If the <code>ZendJobQueue::getCurrentJobId()</code> returns a falsy value,
    then it was not invoked via Job Queue, and you can exit immediately. I like
    to set a 403 status in these situations as well, but that's just a personal
    preference.
</p>

<h2>Next time...</h2>

<p>
    The next tip in the series is builds on this one, and gives some best
    practices to follow when writing your job scripts.

      <title>Deployment with Zend Server (Part 3 of 8)</title>

    This is the third in a series of eight posts detailing tips on deploying
    to Zend Server. <a href="/blog/2014-08-28-zend-server-deployment-part-2.html">The previous post in the series</a>
    detailed creating recurring jobs via Zend Job Queue, à la cronjobs.
</p>

<p>
    Today, I'm sharing a very short deployment script tip learned by experience.
</p><h2>Tip 3: chmod</h2>

<p>
    In the <a href="/blog/2014-08-11-zend-server-deployment-part-1.html">first tip</a>,
    I detailed writing deployment scripts. One of the snippets I shared was a <kbd>chmod</kbd>
    routine:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
$command = 'chmod -R a+rwX ./data';
echo "\nExecuting `$command`\n";
system($command);
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    The code is fine; what I did not share is <em>where</em> in the deployment script
    you should invoke it. As I discovered from experience, this is key.
</p>

<p>
    Zend Server's deployment scripts run as the <kbd>zend</kbd> user. If they are 
    writing any data to the <kbd>data</kbd> directory, that data is owned by the <kbd>zend</kbd> 
    user and group -- and often will not be writable by the web server user.  If you 
    have scheduled jobs that need to write to the same files, they will fail... 
    unless you have done the <kbd>chmod</kbd> after your deployment tasks are done.
</p>

<p>
    So, that's today's tip: if you need any directory in your application to be
    writable by scheduled jobs, which will run as the web server user, make sure
    you do your <kbd>chmod</kbd> as the last step of your deployment script.
</p>

    secure your Job Queue job scripts.

    This is the second in a series of eight posts detailing tips on deploying
    to Zend Server. <a href="/blog/2014-08-11-zend-server-deployment-part-1.html">The previous post in the series</a>
    detailed getting started with <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/solutions/cloud-solutions/aws-marketplace">Zend
    Server on the AWS marketplace</a> and using <a href="https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy">zf-deploy</a>
    to create ZPK packages to deploy to Zend Server.
</p>

<p>
    Today, I'm looking at how to created scheduled/recurring jobs using Zend Server's Job Queue;
    think of this as application-level cronjobs.
</p><h2>Tip 2: Recurring Jobs</h2>

<p>
    I needed to define a few recurring jobs on the server. In the past, I've 
    used <kbd>cron</kbd> for this, but I've recently had a slight change of mind on 
    this: if I use <kbd>cron</kbd>, I have to assume I'm running on a unix-like system, 
    and have some sort of system access to the server. If I have multiple 
    servers running, that means ensuring they're setup on each server. It seems 
    better to be able to define these jobs at the applicaton level.
</p>

<p>
    Since Zend Server comes with Job Queue, I decided to try it out for 
    scheduling recurring jobs. This is not terribly intuitive, however. The UI 
    allows you to define scheduled jobs... but only gives options for every 
    minute, hour, day, week, and month, without allowing you to specify the 
    exact interval (e.g., every day at 20:00).

<p>
    The PHP API, however, makes this easy. I can create a job as follows:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
$queue = new ZendJobQueue();
$queue->createHttpJob('/jobs/github-feed.php', [], [
  'name'       => 'github-feed',
  'persistent' => false,
  'schedule'   => '5,20,35,40 * * * *',
]);
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    Essentially, you provide a URL to the script to execute (Job Queue "runs" a 
    job by accessing a URL on the server), and provide a schedule in crontab 
    format. I like to give my jobs names as well, as it allows me to search for 
    them in the UI, and also enables linking between the rules and the logs in 
    the UI. Marking them as <em>not</em> persistent ensures that if the job is 
    successful, it will be removed from the events list.
</p>

<p>
    The question is, where do you define this? I decided to do this in my 
    <kbd>post_activate.php</kbd> deployment script. However, this raises two new 
    problems:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rules need not just a path to the script, but also the scheme and host. 
        You _can_ omit those, but only if the script can resolve them via 
        <kbd>$_SERVER</kbd>... which it cannot due during deployment.</li>
    <li>Each deployment adds the jobs you define... but this does not overwrite 
        or remove the jobs you added in previous deployments.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I solved these as follows:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
$server = 'http://mwop.net';

// Remove previously scheduled jobs:
$queue = new ZendJobQueue();
foreach ($queue->getSchedulingRules() as $job) {
    if (0 !== strpos($job['script'], $server)) {
        // not one we're interested in
        continue;
    }

    // Remove previously scheduled job
    $queue->deleteSchedulingRule($job['id']);
}

$queue->createHttpJob($server . '/jobs/github-feed.php', [], [
  'name'       => 'github-feed',
  'persistent' => false,
  'schedule'   => '5,20,35,40 * * * *',
]);
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    So, in summary:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Define your rules with names.</li>
    <li>Define recurring rules using the <kbd>schedule</kbd> option.</li>
    <li>Define recurring rules in your deployment script, during <kbd>post_activate</kbd>.</li>
    <li>Remove previously defined rules in your deployment script, prior to defining them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next time...</h2>

<p>
    The next tip in the series is a short one, perfect for following the US 
    Labor Day weekend, and details something I learned the hard way from Tip 1 
    when setting up deployment tasks.

    I manage a number of websites running on Zend Server, Zend's PHP 
    application platform. I've started accumulating a number of patterns and 
    tricks that make the deployments more successful, and which also allow 
    me to do more advanced things such as setting up recurring jobs for the 
    application, clearing page caches, and more.
</p><h2>Yes, YOU can afford Zend Server</h2>

<p>
    "But, wait, Zend Server is uber-expensive!" I hear some folks saying.
</p>

<p>
    Well, yes and no.
</p>

<p>
    With the release of Zend Server 7, Zend now offers a "Development 
    Edition" that contains all the features I've covered here, and which 
    runs $195. This makes it affordable for small shops and freelancers, 
    but potentially out of the reach of individuals.
</p>

<p>
    But there's another option, which I'm using, which is even more 
    intriguing: <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/solutions/cloud-solutions/aws-marketplace">Zend Server on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace</a>. 
    On AWS, you can try out Zend Server free for 30 days. After that, 
    you get charged a fee on top of your normal AWS EC2 usage. Depending 
    on the EC2 instance you choose, this can run as low as ~$24/month 
    (this is on the t1.micro, and that's the total per month for both 
    AWS and Zend Server usage). That's cheaper than most VPS hosting or 
    PaaS providers, and gives you a full license for Zend Server.
</p>

<p>
    Considering Zend Server is available on almost every PaaS and IaaS 
    offering available, this is a great way to try it out, as well as to 
    setup staging and testing servers cheaply; you can then choose the
    provider you want based on its other features. For those of you running 
    low traffic or small, personal or hobbyist sites, it's an 
    inexpensive alternative to VPS hosting.
</p>

<p>
    So... onwards with my first tip.
</p>

<h2>Tip 1: zf-deploy</h2>

<p>
    My first trick is to use 
    <a href="https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy">zf-deploy</a>. This is a tool 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ezimuel">Enrico</a> and I wrote when prepping 
    <a href="https://apigility.org">Apigility</a> for its initial stable release. 
    It allows you to create deployment packages from your application, 
    including zip, tarball, and ZPKs (Zend Server deployment packages). 
    We designed it to simplify packaging <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework 2</a> and Apigility applications, but with a 
    small amount of work, it could likely be used for a greater variety 
    of PHP applications.
</p>

<p>
    zf-deploy takes the current state of your working directory, and 
    clones it to a working path. It then runs Composer (though you can 
    disable this), and strips out anything configured in your 
    <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file (again, you can disable this). From there, it 
    creates your package.
</p>

<p>
    One optional piece is that, when creating a ZPK, you can tell it 
    which <kbd>deployment.xml</kbd> you want to use and/or specify a directory 
    containing the <kbd>deployment.xml</kbd> and any install scripts you want to 
    include in the package. This latter is incredibly useful, as you can 
    use this to shape your deployment.
</p>

<p>
    As an example, on my own website, I have a CLI job that will fetch 
    my latest <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> activity. I can invoke that 
    in my <kbd>post_stage.php</kbd> script:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
if (! chdir(getenv('ZS_APPLICATION_BASE_DIR'))) {
  throw new Exception('Unable to change to application directory');
}

$php = '/usr/local/zend/bin/php';

$command = $php . ' public/index.php githubfeed fetch';
echo "\nExecuting `$command`\n";
system($command);
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    One task I always do is make sure my application data directory is 
    writable by the web server. This next line builds on the above, in 
    that it assumes you've changed to your application directory first:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
$command = 'chmod -R a+rwX ./data';
echo "\nExecuting `$command`\n";
system($command);
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    Yes, PHP has a built-in for <kbd>chmod</kbd>, but it doesn't act recursively.
</p>

<p>
    For ZF2 and Apigility applications, zf-deploy also allows you to 
    specify a directory that contains the <kbd>*local.php</kbd> config 
    scripts for your <kbd>config/autoload/</kbd> directory, allowing you to 
    merge in configuration specific for the deployment environment. 
    This is a fantastic capability, as I can keep any private 
    configuration separate from my main repository.
</p>

<p>
    Deployment now becomes:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="bash">
$ vendor/bin/zfdeploy.php mwop.net.zpk --configs=../mwop.net-config --zpk=zpk
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    and I now have a ZPK ready to push to Zend Server.
</p>

<p>
    In sum: zf-deploy simplifies ZPK creation, and allows you to add 
    deployment scripts that let you perform other tasks on the server.
</p>

      <title>Testing Code That Emits Output</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2014 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://mwop.net/blog/2014-08-11-testing-output-generating-code.html</link>
      <guid>http://mwop.net/blog/2014-08-11-testing-output-generating-code.html</guid>

      <dc:creator>Matthew Weier O'Phinney</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    Here's the scenario: you have code that will emit headers and content,
    for instance, a front controller. How do you test this?
</p>

<p>
    The answer is remarkably simple, but non-obvious: namespaces.
</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
    For this approach to work, the assumptions are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your code emitting headers and output lives in a namespace other than the global namespace.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    That's it. Considering that most PHP code you grab anymore does this, and
    most coding standards you run across will require this, it's a safe bet
    that you're already ready. If you're not, go refactor your code now, before
    continuing; you'll thank me later.
</p>

<h2>The technique</h2>

<p>
    PHP introduced namespaces in PHP 5.3. Namespaces cover classes, as most of
    us are well aware, but they also cover constants and functions -- a fact
    often overlooked, as before 5.6 (releasing next week!), you cannot import
    them via <kbd>use</kbd> statements!
</p>

<p>
    That does not mean they cannot be defined and used, however -- it just
    means that you need to manually import them, typically via a
    <kbd>require</kbd> or <kbd>require_once</kbd> statement. These are usually
    anathema in libraries, but for testing, they work just fine.
</p>

<p>
    Here's an approach I took recently. I created a file that lives -- this is
    the important bit, so pay attention -- <em>in the same namespace as the
    code emitting headers and output</em>. This file defines several functions
    that live in the global (aka PHP's built-in) namespace, and an accumulator
    static object I can then use in my tests for assertions. Here's what it
    looks like:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
namespace Some\Project;

abstract class Output
{
    public static $headers = array();
    public static $body;

    public static function reset()
    {
        self::$headers = array();
        self::$body = null;
    }
}

function headers_sent()
{
    return false;
}

function header($value)
{
    Output::$headers[] = $value;
}

function printf($text)
{
    Output::$body .= $text;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    A few notes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><kbd>headers_sent()</kbd> always returns <kbd>false</kbd> here, as most
        emitters test for a boolean <kbd>true</kbd> value and bail early when
        that occurs.</li>

    <li>I used <kbd>printf()</kbd> here, as <kbd>echo</kbd> cannot be overridden
        due to being a PHP language construct and not an actual function. As such,
        if you use this technique, you will have to likely alter your emitter
        to call <kbd>printf()</kbd> instead of <kbd>echo</kbd>. The benefits,
        however, are worth it.</li>

    <li>I marked <kbd>Output</kbd> abstract, to prevent instantiation; it should
        only be used statically.</kbd>
</ul>

<p>
    I place the above file within my test suite, usually under a "TestAsset"
    directory adjacent to the test itself; since it contains functions, I'll 
    name the file "Functions.php" as well. This combination typically will 
    prevent it from being autoloaded in any way, as the test directory will 
    often not have autoloading defined, or will be under a separate namespace.
</p>

<p>
    Inside your PHPUnit test suite, then, you would do the following:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
namespace SomeTest\Project;

use PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase as TestCase;
use Some\Project\FrontController;
use Some\Project\Output;                 // <-- our Output class from above
require_once __DIR__ . '/TestAsset/Functions.php'; // <-- get our functions

class FrontControllerTest extends TestCase
{
    public function setUp()
    {
        Output::reset();
        /* ... */
    }

    public function tearDown()
    {
        Output::reset();
        /* ... */
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    From here, you test as normal -- but when you invoke methods that will
    cause headers or content to emit, you can now test to see what those
    contain:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
public function testEmitsExpectedHeadersAndContent()
{
    /* ... */

    $this->assertContains('Content-Type: application/json', Output::$headers);
    $json = Output::$body;
    $data = json_decode($json, true);
    $this->assertArrayHasKey('foo', $data);
    $this->assertEquals('bar', $data['foo']);
}
</code></pre></div>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>
    Why does this work?
</p>

<p>
    PHP performs some magic when it resolves functions. With classes, it looks
    for a matching class either in the current namespace, or one that was
    imported (and potentially aliased); if a match is not found, it stops, and
    raises an error. With functions, however, it looks first in the current
    namespace, and if it isn't found, then looks in the global namespace. This
    last part is key -- it means that if you redefine a function in the current
    namespace, it will be used in lieu of the original function defined by
    PHP. This also means that any code operating in the same namespace as the 
    function -- even if defined in another file -- will use that function.
</p>

<p>
    This technique just leverages this fact.

      <title>Better Understanding Controllers Through Basic Patterns</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/">Paul M. Jones</a> has started an interesting
    discussion rethinking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>
    pattern as applied to the web, which he has dubbed <a href="https://github.com/pmjones/mvc-refinement">Action-Domain-Responder (ADR)</a>.
    If you haven't given it a read yet, click the link and do that; this page will
    still be sitting here waiting when you return.
</p>

<p>
    I agree with a ton of it &#8212; heck, I've contributed to it a fair bit via conversations
    with Paul. But there's been one thing nagging at me for a bit now, and I was
    finally able to put it into words recently.
</p>

<p>
    Controllers &#8212; Actions in ADR &#8212; can be explained as <em>facades</em>.
</p><h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
    The design pattern <em>Facade</em> originates in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
    Object Oriented Software," written by Erich Gamma, Ralph Johnson, Richard Helm, and John
    Vlissides. Over the years, that book has come to be referred to as the "Gang of Four",
    referring to the four authors, and often abbreviated as "GoF".
</p>

<p>
    The Facade pattern itself is one of the seven structural design patterns defined in the GoF.
    Structural design patterns are those that provide a mechanism for defining the <em>relationships</em>
    between classes or objects in a system. Specifically:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Facade defines a simplifed interface to a complex system.
</blockquote>

<p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">Wikipedia has a general entry on the pattern</a>
    as well, and provides some other general characteristics of a Facade:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A Facade creates a convenience method around a set of operations, thus
        reducing the complexity of operations.</li>
    <li>A Facade reduces the immediate dependencies of the calling code (they call the Facade, not the underlying code).
</ul>

<h2>Facade Example</h2>

<p>
    As an example, let's consider the following workflow:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Marshal some objects</li>
    <li>Munge some incoming data</li>
    <li>Call a validator</li>
    <li>If the data does not validate, raise an error</li>
    <li>Start a transaction</li>
    <li>Pass data to several different tables</li>
    <li>Commit the transaction</li>
    <li>Log the changes</li>
    <li>Email notifications</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Now, we could just write the code:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
$db     = new Db($connectionConfig);
$log    = new Logger($loggerConfig);
$mailer = new Mailer($mailerConfig);
$data   = array_merge_recursive($_POST, $_FILES);

$inputFilter = new InputFilter();
$inputFilter->setData($data);
if (! $inputFilter->isValid()) {
    throw new DomainException();
}

$db->transactionStart();
$db->insertInto(/* ... */);
$db->insertInto(/* ... */);
$db->insertInto(/* ... */);
$db->transactionStop();

$log->info('Finished a transaction');
$mailer->send('New transaction')
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    Straight-forward. But imagine if you needed to do this more than once. Or if
    you wanted to re-use this logic in multiple places in your application. This
    is a situation just waiting to go out-of-sync &#8212; and one where developers
    will come to rely on cut-and-paste for doing it correctly.
</p>

<p>
    A facade would wrap this logic:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
class DataTransaction
{
    protected $db;
    protected $logger;
    protected $mailer;

    public function __construct(Db $db, Logger $logger, Mailer $mailer)
    {
        $this->db     = $db;
        $this->logger = $logger;
        $this->mailer = $mailer;
    }

    public function execute($data)
    {
        $inputFilter = new InputFilter();
        $inputFilter->setData($data);
        if (! $inputFilter->isValid()) {
            throw new DomainException();
        }

        $this->db->transactionStart();
        $this->db->insertInto(/* ... */);
        $this->db->insertInto(/* ... */);
        $this->db->insertInto(/* ... */);
        $this->db->transactionStop();

        $this->logger->info('Finished a transaction');
        $this->mailer->send('New transaction')
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    You would then instantiate the facade &#8212; likely using an
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">Inversion of Control</a>
    container to inject the dependencies &#8212; and then invoke it:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code language="php">
$dataTransaction->execute(array_merge_recursive($_POST, $_FILES));
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    This code fulfills the Facade pattern: we're no longer directly manipulating dependencies,
    and we've simplified a complex set of operations to a single, unified API.
</p>

<h2>Controllers and Actions</h2>

<p>
    Hopefully you can see where I'm going with this.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Controllers in MVC, and Actions in ADR, are best characterized as Facades.
</blockquote>

<p>
    You can define Controllers or Actions as Facades for the following operations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Marshaling arguments from the request.</li>
    <li>Invoking any domain/model logic, using arguments marshaled from the request.</li>
    <li>Marshaling and returning a response/responder.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I think characterizing Controllers and Actions as Facades has some huge benefits.
    In both <a href="http://blog.astrumfutura.com/archives/373-The-M-in-MVC-Why-Models-are-Misunderstood-and-Unappreciated.html">PHP</a>
    and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fat+controllers+rails">Rails</a>,
    we've witnessed the problems that arise from so-called "Fat Controllers" &#8212;
    controllers that do a ton of work, making them untestable, unreadable, non-reusable
    nightmares. If we think of them as Facades, specifically for the three items
    noted above, we focus on the specific purpose they fulfill within the system,
    giving us:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adherence to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a></li>
    <li>Adherence to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion Priniciple</a></li>
    <li>Adherence to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a></li>
    <li>Ability to unit test our Controllers and Actions (instead of requiring integration tests with complex configuration and setup)</li>
    <li>The possibility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">hierarchical MVC</a> (usually tacked on, or poorly implemented)</li>
    <li>Clarity of purpose when creating Controllers and Actions (do only those three things)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Defining them as Facades for these three specific operations means we push logic
    into specific domains, achieving a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a>.
    Anything that falls outside those three operations gets pushed elsewhere:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Models/Domains are invoked with the arguments marshaled from the request. If you find yourself
        calling many models, or manipulating the results returned by models, you need to create
        Facades in your model/domain layer.</li>
    <li>If you find yourself doing lots of work in creating your response, you need to create
        a Facade for marshaling the response (in ADR, that would mean encapsulating more logic
        in your Responder).
</ul>

<p>
    For me, thinking of Controllers and Actions as Facades has an additional benefit:
    it describes rather complex <em>architectural</em> patterns in terms of <em>basic design
    patterns</em>. I find the more I can reduce the complexity of a definition, the more
    likely I will understand and use it correctly.
</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>
    Consider this post a <em>refinement</em> of the MVC and ADR architectural 
    patterns &#8212; a way of describing them in terms of more fundamental design patterns.
</p>

<p>
    Also, this article is littered with links. Click them. Read them. Digest them. Read the books
    they reference. Design and architectural patterns exist because developers observed the
    patterns and gave them names; learn to recognize them and apply them, at all levels of
    your application.

    That time of year again -- wrap-up time. Each year, it seems like it's the
    busiest ever, and I often wonder if it will ever slow down. As usual, I'm
    restricting myself to primarily professional activities out of respect for
    the privacy of my family.

</ul>

<p>
    Read on for the gruesome, month-by-month breakdown.
</p><h2>January and February</h2>

<p>
    I started coding <code>Zend_Form</code> in earnest in January, and had a
    preview ready for testing mid-month. The pace continued into February, as I
    addressed user feedback and issues, and continued working feverishly towards
    what would become Zend Framework's 1.5.0 release.
</p>

<p>
    I also answered many questions for and had many discussions with 
    <a href="http://www.calevans.com/">Cal Evans</a> relating to his "Guide to
    Programming Zend Framework".
</p>

<h2>March</h2>

<p>
    I gave my first webinar of the year early in March, on the subject of
    <code>Zend_Form</code>; it was very well attended, but unfortunately there
    was an issue recording the sound, so the recording was never released. After
    two more failed attempts at re-recording, we gave up. I apologize to all who
    have wanted to view it.
</p>

<p>
    While working towards the 1.5.0 release, <a href="http://ralphschindler.com/">Ralph Schindler</a>
    and I also finished up final touches on <code>Zend_Layout</code> and the
    various "placeholder" view helper implementations.
</p>

<p>
    On 17 March 2008, we released Zend Framework 1.5, our first minor release
    following 1.0.0.
</p>

<p>
    I started blogging tips and tricks for 1.5, and also writing articles for
    <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/">DevZone</a> during March, and had
    tremendous amounts of feedback. In fact, one blog post, on "Login and
    Authentication", is still one of the most trafficked on my blog after 9
    months.
</p>

<p>
    I also began what I envisioned as a series of Vim posts, but, alas, it has
    resulted only in two.
</p>

<h2>April</h2>

<p>
    Following the 1.5 release, I did weekly posts for a month or so covering
    various features of Zend Framework, including Front Controller plugins,
    Action Controller helpers, and View helpers. Towards the end of the month,
    the entire team participated in a Q&amp;A webinar to discuss the 1.5
    release.
</p>

<h2>May</h2>

<p>
    At the beginning of the month, I released the last in my series of 1.5
    tutorials on <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/">DevZone</a>, covering Form
    decorators. This has saved me countless hours on IRC and in the mailing
    lists explaining how this aspect of forms work.
</p>

<p>
    During this month, we also finally announced that Zend Framework would be
    partnering with <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> to provide an
    out-of-the-box RIA solution. I began work identifying the various
    integration points and creating proposals for implementation. I also did a
    Q&amp;A webinar with the Dojo team outlining the proposed integration.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the month, the ZF team reorganized the subversion repository
    to allow for an "Extras" repository, and also to ensure that projects
    originating in the laboratory or extras and migrating to the standard
    library retain all history. Even with the big notices we put on the ZF site,
    articles on DevZone, and posts on various blogs, we still get questions on
    this seven months later. Let this be a lesson to you: plan your repositories
    for any contingency as early as you can!
</p>

<h2>June</h2>

<p>
    I started June with a trip to Israel, to visit the Zend offices. I met up
    with <a href="http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/">Andi</a> in Newark, and we
    flew from there to Israel several rows apart in coach. One of the best meals
    I've ever had was after we landed and he invited me to his sister's place
    for dinner, and we dined on chicken marinated in home-pressed olive oil and
    fresh herbs, hummus, and pitas baked with fresh oregano. The rest of the
    week was spent in the office, in endless meetings.
</p>

<p>
    Four days after returning from Israel, I flew to Amsterdam for the 
    <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl">Dutch PHP Conference</a>, to which I'd
    been invited to speak. My good friend <a href="http://wolerized.com/">Remi</a> 
    took the
    train up to Amsterdam to meet me the day I flew in, and we walked and walked
    and walked around the city, until dinnertime. 
    <a href="http://www.leftontheweb.com/">Stefan Koopmanschap</a> then met us
    for a lovely dinner, and I returned to the hotel to finish screenshots for
    the six-hour workshop on Zend Framework I was presenting the next day. The
    entire conference was wonderful, and I met many fantastic people, including
    <a href="http://www.priebsch.de/">Stefan Priebsch</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/">Lorna Jane Mitchell</a>, 
    <a href="http://andries.systray.be/">Andries Seutens</a>, and many, many
    more -- plus many familiar faces, such as Sebastian Bergmann, Derek Rethans,
    Mike Van Dam, Felix de Vliegher, and Marco Tabini.
</p>

<p>
    On my blog, I started raising the question of how we will refer to Abstract
    classes and Interfaces in PHP 5.3, but I think my arguments went largely
    unheard and/or misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
    The last half of the month was spent working on both Dojo integration with
    Zend Framework (a task that turned out fairly easy, in large part due to
    some wonderful guidance from <a href="http://higginsforpresident.net/">Pete Higgins</a>), 
    and preparing <code>Zend_Test_PHPUnit</code> for inclusion in Zend Framework
    1.6.
</p>

<h2>July</h2>

<p>
    I think I'll remember July as the month of the neverending release cycle.
</p>

<h2>August</h2>

<p>
    On 8 August 2008, PHP 4 officially died. I thought about drinking a toast
    for about 3 seconds, forgot about it, and finished my beer.
</p>

<p>
    The following Monday, we released the second release candidate of Zend
    Framework 1.6.0. 
</p>

<p>
    August, too, became part of the month of the neverending release cycle.
</p>
    
<h2>September</h2>

<p>
    Finally, on 2 September 2008, we released 1.6.0 into the wild.  My
    contributions included, as noted earlier, Dojo integration, PHPUnit
    integration, and code assistance on our Captcha solution and file upload
    support.
</p>

<p>
    The next day, I gave yet another webinar on Zend Framework and Dojo
    integration, but finally actually had some code samples and working demos to
    show off, soundly quieting the claims of vaporware. I also started
    learning about Dojo release builds, under the tutelage of Pete Higgins.
</p>

<p>
    Mid-month saw the fourth annual Zend/PHP Conference, this time in Santa
    Clara. I was involved in a marathon of seven different sessions over three
    days. I've rarely been so exhausted, and it's a wonder I remember anything
    following -- but I had a wonderful time with the PHP <em>community</em>
    following, including <a href="http://www.bombdiggity.net/">Jon
        Whitcraft</a>, <a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</a>, the <a
        href="http://ibuildings.nl/">ibuildings</a> crew, and
    more. 
</p>
    
<p>
    I also finally got to meet <a href="http://sklar.com/">David Sklar</a>, to
    whom I owe the fact of my first public speaking engagement at the first
    ZendCon.
</p>

<p>
    Following ZendCon, there were announcements that two colleagues at Zend I
    respect highly were leaving for new opportunities: Mark de Visser left to
    join Sonatype as its CEO, and Cal Evans left to head ibuildings' new Center
    for PHP Expertise. I wish them both luck in their new endeavors.
</p>

<h2>October</h2>

<p>
    I helped <a href="http://wadearnold.com/blog/">Wade Arnold</a> complete
    testing of <code>Zend_Amf</code> as we prepared for the Zend Framework 1.7.0
    release, and learned a fair deal about Flex in the process.
</p>

<p>
    During this time, I also completed a technical review of 
    <a href="http://zendframeworkinaction.com">Zend Framework in Action</a>. 
    Rob Allen and Nick Lo had contacted me earlier in the year, but I'd
    been unable to commit to it. In July, I agreed, only to get sucked into the
    neverending release cycle. Fortunately, in October I had time to complete
    the review. The book is very well written and organized, and I can't
    recommend it highly enough. I was able to give some constructive feedback
    and have some dialog with Rob that, hopefully, helped clarify a few areas of
    Zend Framework, and will hopefully help their readers.
</p>

<p>
    For the 1.7 release of Zend Framework, I worked on performance benchmarking,
    profiling, improvements, and a best practices guide.
</p>

<p>
    Late in the month, I delivered a webinar with Lee Brimelow for Adobe to
    showcase the upcoming AMF support in Zend Framework.
</p>

<h2>November</h2>

<p>
    The last few days of October and first week of November, I organized a bug
    hunt week for Zend Framework, culminating in a 
    <a href="http://bughuntday.org/">Bug Hunt Day</a> event held and organized
    by <a href="http://www.phpbelgium.be/">PHP Belgium</a> and 
    <a href="http://phpgg.nl/">phpGG</a> (The Netherlands). We closed out close
    to 150 issues over the course of the week and a couple dozen during the Bug
    Hunt Day, and got many contributors started on the path of professional bug
    squashing enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
    The second week of November, I flew down to Atlanta, GA, to attend
    <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/">php|works</a>.. err,
    php|works/pyworks.  First off, a huge thank you to 
    <a href="http://naramore.net/blog/">Elizabeth Naramore</a>, who
    helped me fairly last minute to make sure I had a room to stay in. While
    there, I presented my Dojo and Zend Framework talk, but with some updated
    content. Of course, every presenter's nightmare occurred, and I had to
    reboot my laptop mid-stream. I surprised myself, and, I think, the attendees
    by actually being able to continue speaking while we waited for my machine
    to reboot.
</p>

<p>
    I also presented a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">Pecha Kucha</a> 
    talk -- I re-branded the phrase as "Pikachu" a couple weeks earlier (a
    reference to the iconic character in <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/">Pokemon</a>, 
    a game I play with my daughter), and that phrase has, for better or for
    worse, stuck. My talk was on how to be banned from an open source project,
    and I swore entirely too much. It was a nice release, however, as I try to
    be politic in public usually, and sometimes just need to rant.
</p>

<p>
    I got to see a ton of old and new friends alike while there -- former
    Zenders <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike Naberezny</a> and 
    <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/">Paul M. Jones</a>, 
    <a href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog/">Keith Casey</a>, 
    <a href="http://ishouldbecoding.com/">Matthew Turland</a>, 
    <a href="http://jansch.nl/">Ivo</a>
    and a bunch of the ibuildings crew, Pollita (sorry, I have to stop linking
    everyone now...), Sebastian... basically, a ton of the usual suspects. I
    also met a lot of new people, many of them introducing themselves as ZF
    users; I appreciate all of you introducing yourselves, as <em>you</em> are
    the reason I code.
</p>

<p>
    The following Monday, 17 November 2008, we released Zend Framework 1.7.0,
    timed to coincide with the the Adobe MAX conference, as AMF support was our
    major story for the release. <code>Zend_Amf</code> has generated tremendous
    buzz in both the PHP and Flash/Flex communities, due to the simplicity and
    robustness of its design. This release also marked the first release to
    include the extras repository -- which now ships with community-contributed

<h2>December</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://shiflett.org/">Chris Shiflett</a> and 
    <a href="http://seancoates.com/">Sean Coates</a> organized this year's 
    <a href="http://phpadvent.org/2008/">PHP Advent Calendar</a>,
    and solicited entries from a select group of PHP community members a week in
    advance. I didn't volunteer to contribute for the first week, but managed to
    get mine in on the first day... only to see it appear the very next.
    Hopefuly, my guide to responsible contributions will help those wondering
    how to report and/or fix bugs in open source projects.
</p>

<p>
    I started blogging more, in part due to more free time in the evenings (it's
    nice when the kids go to bed at a reasonable hour!), and in part due to
    finally putting a number of ideas into a blogging "backlog" so that I could
    pick up and post when I had time. From this, I added an entry on
    mumbles/irssi integration, autocompletion with ZF and Dojo, created a simple
    pubsub implementation for PHP, and started a series of posts on how to
    architect models (and some concrete tips for doing so). I have more posts in
    December than I have in several other months combined.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
    This past year, I became much more involved with both the Zend Framework and
    greater PHP communities, and feel I have enriched my life with many
    wonderful new friends -- some local, some global. I feel truly fortunate to
    be working in a job I love, contributing to a project that helps others do
    the jobs they love, and part of such an accepting and vibrant group of
    people.
</p>

<p>
    Looking back, I travelled less, though because most of it was in a five
    month period, it felt like more. On that note, I vow never to do back to
    back trips across the big pond, as it was incredibly exhausting.
</p>

<h2>Looking ahead to 2009</h2>

<p>
    I have several things to look forward to already in 2009.  I'll be
    continuing my series of posts on models. In February, I will have an article
    published in a print magazine for the first tiem.  I'll be speaking at PHP
    Quebec in March, presenting two sessions and sitting in on a panel. I hope
    to speak at several other conferences, and potentially write more articles
    and tutorials. Overall, I want to contribute more to the ecosystem of best
    practices in PHP, particularly in the areas of testing and deployment
    strategies.
</p>

<p>
    I hope this post finds <em>you</em> in good health and spirits, and that you
    have a fantastic start to the new year!

      <title>Mumbles irssi integration</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2008 20:19:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://mwop.net/blog/197-Mumbles-irssi-integration.html</link>
      <guid>http://mwop.net/blog/197-Mumbles-irssi-integration.html</guid>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    I've been using IRC regularly for the past six to nine months, in large part
    due to the growing ZF community on the 
    <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> #zftalk channel (unfortunately,
    I simply don't have time to be in that particular channel any more, but you
    can generally find me in #zftalk.dev), but also to keep in contact with
    other peers, friends, and colleagues. 
</p>

<p>
    One difficulty, however, is keeping productivity high while staying on IRC.
    To me, the ultimate client would provide me notifications when somebody
    mentions my name or a watch word - allowing me to read the channel at my
    leisure, yet still respond to people in a timely fashion.
</p><p>
    I've tried a variety of IRC clients over the months, starting with Pidgin
    (poor interface for IRC), mirc (huge difficulties figuring out the UI),
    xchat (not bad, but seemed a bit heavy), Chatzilla (I liked the interface,
    but once you got many tabs going, it was unwieldy switching around between
    them; I also hated that Firefox dying or restarting caused Chatzilla to do
    likewise), and now <a href="http://irssi.org/">irssi</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    So far, irssi is the best I've tried -- I can run it in screen,
    allowing me to keep it open as long as my machine is running. The interface
    is reasonable, and cleanly keeps channels separate from private messages.
    Opening, closing, and manipulating windows is easy. And it's highly
    scriptable... including in a language I actually use! The perl bindings are
    top notch, though sometimes cryptic. What's important, however, is that
    there are plenty of examples out there if you want to try doing something.
    So, I figured I'd write up a quick plugin to trigger notifications.
</p>

<p>
    I've been using a number of different notification servers for linux, and
    personally like both <a href="http://gnotify.sourceforge.net">gnotify</a>
    and <a href="http://www.mumbles-project.org/">mumbles</a>. Both are very
    lightweight and offer network protocols for triggering notifications.
</p>

<p>
    I first tried using gnotify. It has a very, very simple TCP protocol, and
    I've had success creating messages from the shell, PHP, and perl.
    Unfortunately, for some reason, using it in irssi displayed some odd
    behavior: I'd lose the cursor and the ability to enter input from the time a
    notification triggered until it completed (i.e., the notification
    disappeared). Forking the process did not appear to help.
</p>

<p>
    So, I decided to try out mumbles. Mumbles is written in python, and has
    themeable notifications -- already a plus. It runs via dbus by default, but
    can also optionally spawn a server that implements the 
    <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl protocol</a> -- making it accessible for
    any process to send notifications. Additionally, it has a command-line
    utility for triggering notifications -- by default over dbus, but optionally
    by contacting the growl server, if running.
</p>

<p>
    Growl's protocol is a bit involved, and I didn't want to spend too much time
    on this. So, I did a quick, dirty hack: I used backticks to trigger the CLI
    utility. And it works <em>fantastically</em> -- no delays whatsoever. Here's
    the code:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre><code lang="perl">
# $HOME/.irssi/scripts/mumbles.pl
use strict;
use Irssi;
use Irssi::Irc;
use vars qw($VERSION %IRSSI);

$VERSION = '0.1.0';
%IRSSI = (
    authors     =&gt; \&quot;Matthew Weier O'Phinney\&quot;,
    contact     =&gt; 'matthew@weierophinney.net',
    name        =&gt; 'Mumbles notifications for irssi',
    description =&gt; 'This script enables mumbles notifications for irssi',
    license     =&gt; 'New BSD',
	changed     =&gt; \&quot;2008-12-10\&quot;
);


sub mumbles_sig_printtext {
  my ($dest, $text, $stripped) = @_;

  if (($dest-&gt;{level} &amp; (MSGLEVEL_HILIGHT|MSGLEVEL_MSGS)) &amp;&amp; ($dest-&gt;{level} &amp; MSGLEVEL_NOHILIGHT) == 0)
  {
    if ($dest-&gt;{level} &amp; MSGLEVEL_PUBLIC)
    {
      mumbles($dest-&gt;{target} . \&quot; : \&quot; . $text);
    }
  }
}

sub mumbles {
    my $message = shift;
    my $response;

    $message =~ s/[^!-~\s]//g;

    `/usr/bin/mumbles-send -g 127.0.0.1 -s \&quot;IRC\&quot; \&quot;$message\&quot;`;
}

Irssi::command_bind 'mumbles' =&gt; sub {
    my ($message) = @_;
    mumbles($message);
};

Irssi::signal_add({
  'print text'    =&gt; \&amp;mumbles_sig_printtext
});
</code></pre></div>

<p>
    This triggers a notification for any "highlight" event -- basically, anytime
    anybody "says" my name in a channel, or mentions a keyword I've marked for
    highlighting. Additionally, I created a "mumbles" command so that I can send
    test messages (usage: "/mumbles "this is the message..."). You could
    certainly bind to other events, such as topic changes, joins, parts, etc --
    I'm only interested in highlight events.
</p>

<p>
    You may note the regexp in there. One thing I discovered was that most
    messages contained control and non-ascii characters that often resulted in
    unreadable notifications, as well as some nasty messages reported by irssi.
    The regexp removes anything not in the ascii character set or the set of
    whitespace definitions prior to emitting the notification.
</p>

<p>
    Something else I needed to do was configure compiz to ensure that the
    notifications actually popped <em>above</em> my windows. I did this by going
    into the compiz configuration manager, selecting "General Options",
    selecting the "Focus &amp; Raise Behaviour" tab, and modifying the "Focus
    Prevention Windows" to read as follows:
</p>

<code><pre>
(any) &amp; !(class=Mumbles)
</pre></code>

<p>
    To test it, I placed the script in $HOME/.irssi/scripts/mumbles.pl, and then, 
    in irssi, executed "/load mumbles.pl".

<p>
    Once I had it to my liking, I symlinked it into my $HOME/.irssi/scripts/autorun/
    directory, allowing it to run as soon as irssi loads. I can now have irssi 
    running in a screen session, or minimize the terminal, and get notifications 
    -- keeping me productive and informed at the same time.
</p>

<p>
    <b>UPDATED 2008-12-12:</b> Added information on how to load the script, as 
    well as fixed the location to the autorun directory. Thanks, @sidhighwind!

      <title>Vimgrep and Vim Project</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2008 01:55:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>http://mwop.net/blog/194-Vimgrep-and-Vim-Project.html</link>
      <guid>http://mwop.net/blog/194-Vimgrep-and-Vim-Project.html</guid>

      <dc:creator>Matthew Weier O'Phinney</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
    Chris Hartjes today was <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2008/10/20/vim-programming-bounty-fuzzyfind-inside-files/">on a quest for a "find in project" feature for Vim</a>.
    "Find in Project" was a feature of Textmate that he'd grown accustomed to
    and was having trouble finding an equivalent for.
</p>

<p>
    The funny thing is that Textmate is a newcomer, and, of course, vim has had
    such a feature for years. The thing to remember with vim, of course, is its
    unix roots; typically if you know the unix command for doing something, you
    can find what you need in vim. In this case, the key is the vimgrep plugin,
    which ships in the standard vim distribution.
</p><p>
    There are a variety of resources on vimgrep. The vim documentation includes
    a chapter on it, and a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vimgrep">google search</a>
    on the subject turns up some nice tutorials immediately. If you've ever used
    grep, the syntax is very straightforward:
</p>

<code><pre>
vimgrep /{pattern}/[g][j] {file} ...
</pre></code>

<p>
    The "g" option indicates that all matches for a search will be returned
    instead of just one per line, and the "j" option tells vim <em>not</em> to
    jump to the first match automatically. What does the "g" flag really mean,
    though, and how are searches returned?
</p>

<p>
    Vimgrep returns search results in what's known as a "quickfix" window, and
    this is where the vimgrep documentation falls apart... it doesn't explain
    what this is, or link to it (which would be a nice indication that it
    actually has a separate topic for this).
</p>

<p>
    The Quickfix window is a pane that shows a search result per line. Each line
    shows the file that matches, the line number, and the contents of that line:
</p>

<code><pre>
/home/matthew/git/bugapp/application/controllers/helpers/GetForm.php|10| * @var Zend_Loader_PluginLoader
</pre></code>

<p>
    You can't do much from this window; it simply serves as a visual indicator
    of what file you're currently looking at from the list. However, in the main
    window, you can start iterating through the results one at a time, using a
    subset of the Quickfix commands. As a quick summary:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>:cc</b> will move to the next match in the list</li>
    <li><b>:cn</b> will move to the next match in the list</li>
    <li><b>:cp</b> will move to the previous match in the list</li>
    <li><b>:cr</b> will rewind to the first match in the list</li>
    <li><b>:cla</b> will fast forward to the last match in the list</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When done, you can simply close the Quickfix window/pane, and continue
    working.
</p>

<p>
    I should note that vimgrep <em>is</em> cross-platform. On *nix-based
    systems, it defaults to using the native grep command, but it also contains
    an internal (slower) implementation for use on operating systems that do not
    provide grep by default. You may also map the command to alternate
    implementations if desired.
</p>

<p>
    I personally use this feature most with the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69">project plugin</a>.
    Project maps vimgrep to two different commands: &lt;Leader&gt;g and
    &lt;Leader&gt;G. The first will grep all files in the current project at the
    current level; the second does the same, but also recurses into subprojects.
    This is an incredibly easy way to refactor code, particularly for name
    changes.

      <title>git-svn Tip: don't use core.autocrlf</title>

    I've been playing around with <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> in the 
    past couple months, and have been really enjoying it. Paired with
    subversion, I get the best of all worlds -- distributed source control when
    I want it (working on new features or trying out performance tuning), and
    non-distributed source control for my public commits.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://github.com/guides/dealing-with-newlines-in-git">Github</a> 
    suggests that when working with remote repositories, you turn on the
    autocrlf option, which ensures that changes in line endings do not get
    accounted for when pushing to and pulling from the remote repo.  However,
    when working with git-svn, this actually causes issues. After turning this
    option on, I started getting the error "Delta source ended unexpectedly"
    from git-svn. After a bunch of aimless tinkering, I finally asked myself the
    questions, "When did this start happening?" and, "Have I changed anything
    with Git lately?" Once I'd backed out the config change, all started working
    again.
</p>

<p>
    In summary: don't use "git config --global core.autocrlf true" when using
    git-svn.
