      <xhtml:div xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><xhtml:p>I'm a big proponent of object oriented programming. OOP done
right helps ease code maintenance and enables code re-use.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Starting in PHP, OOP enthusiasts got a whole bunch of new tools,
and new tools keep coming into the language for us with each minor
release. One feature that has had a huge impact on frameworks and
libraries has been available since the earliest PHP 5 versions:
visibility.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Theory</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>The visibility keywords include <xhtml:em>private</xhtml:em>,
<xhtml:em>protected</xhtml:em>, and <xhtml:em>public</xhtml:em>, often referred to as
<xhtml:strong>PPP</xhtml:strong>. There's an additional keyword I often lump in
with them, <xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em>.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Public visibility is the default, and equivalent to the only
visibility available to PHP prior to version 5: any member declared
public is accessible from any scope. This means the following:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
class Foo
{
    public $bar = 'bar';

    public function baz() 
    {
        // I can access within my own scope
        return $this-&gt;bar;
    }
}

class FooBar extends Foo
{
    public function doThat()
    {
        // I have access to members in my parent
        return $this-&gt;bar . $this-&gt;baz();
    }
}

$foo = new Foo();

// I can access public members from an instance
echo $foo-&gt;bar . $foo-&gt;baz();
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>Basically, public visibility means that I can access the member
from within the object, within an extending class, or from simply
an instance.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Protected visibility starts to tighten things down a little.
With protected visibility, only the class itself, or an extending
class, can access the member:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
class Foo
{
    protected $bar = 'bar';

    protected function baz() 
    {
        // I can access within my own scope
        return $this-&gt;bar;
    }
}

class FooBar extends Foo
{
    public function doThat()
    {
        // I can access protected members in my parent
        return $this-&gt;bar . $this-&gt;baz();
    }
}

$foo = new FooBar();

// This works, as I'm calling a public member of an extending class:
$foo-&gt;doThat();

// But these are both illegal:
echo $foo-&gt;bar . $foo-&gt;baz();
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>Protected visibility is nice for hiding things from those
consuming your class. It can be used to hide implementation
details, and to prevent direct modification of public properties --
something important to consider, if a property may be the product
of calculation, or if a particular type is required.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Private visibility locks things down further. With private
visibility, the object member is only directly modifiable or
callable within the declaring class.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
class Foo
{
    private $bar = 'bar';

    private function baz() 
    {
        // I can access within my own scope
        return $this-&gt;bar;
    }
}

class FooBar extends Foo
{
    public function doThat()
    {
        // These are both illegal
        return $this-&gt;bar . $this-&gt;baz();
    }
}

$foo = new FooBar();

// These are also both illegal:
echo $foo-&gt;bar . $foo-&gt;baz();
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>Private visibility is generally of interest for locking down
algorithms. For instance, if you know that a particular value or
operation must not change, even in extending classes, declaring the
member private ensures that extending classes cannot directly call
it.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>At any point, you can redeclare a property in an extending class
using equal or more public visibility. The effect of doing so
depends on what the visibility of the member was in the parent
class.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>
<xhtml:p>In the case of a <xhtml:em>public</xhtml:em> property, if an extending class
re-declares with public visibility, any access to the member within
the extending class or an instance of the extending class will see
only the new declaration.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
class Foo
{
    public $bar = 'bar';

    public function baz() 
    {
        return $this-&gt;bar;
    }
}

class FooBar extends Foo
{
    public $bar = 'foobar';
}

$foo = new FooBar();
echo $foo-&gt;bar;   // "foobar"
echo $foo-&gt;baz(); // "foobar"
        </xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>
<xhtml:p>In the instance of a <xhtml:em>protected</xhtml:em> property, if the
extending class re-declares with either public or protected
visibility, you get the same behavior as public -&gt; public.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
class Foo
{
    protected $bar = 'bar';

    public function baz() 
    {
        return $this-&gt;bar;
    }
}

class FooBar extends Foo
{
    public $bar = 'foobar';
}

$foo = new FooBar();
echo $foo-&gt;bar;   // "foobar"
echo $foo-&gt;baz(); // "foobar"
        </xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>
<xhtml:p>In the instance of a <xhtml:em>private</xhtml:em> property, things get
interesting. The private value or method will be used for any
access made within code declared in the parent class, but not
overridden in the child. However, if the child class overrides any
code, the value of the re-declared instance will be used. This is
far easier to understand via an example.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
class Foo
{
    private $bar = 'bar';
    private $baz = 'baz';

    public function baz() 
    {
        return $this-&gt;bar;
    }
}

class FooBar extends Foo
{
    protected $bar = 'foobar';
    private $baz = 'foobaz';

    public function myBaz() 
    {
        return $this-&gt;bar;
    }

    public function myBaz2()
    {
        return $this-&gt;baz;
    }
}

$foo = new FooBar();
echo $foo-&gt;baz();    // "bar"
echo $foo-&gt;myBaz();  // "foobar"
echo $foo-&gt;myBaz2(); // "foobaz"
        </xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>My personal takeaway from this is:</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:li>Use <xhtml:em>public</xhtml:em> for members that are safe for anything to
call.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Use <xhtml:em>protected</xhtml:em> for anything you don't want called from
instance methods, not important to the public API (implementation
details), and anything you feel is safe for extending classes to
muck about with.</xhtml:li>
<xhtml:li>Use <xhtml:em>private</xhtml:em> for any important implementation details
that could adversely affect execution if overridden by an extending
class.</xhtml:li>
</xhtml:ul>
<xhtml:p>Those paying attention will note that I skipped <xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em>.
Actually, I saved that for last. Marking a class or method
<xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em> tells PHP that the class or method may not be
extended or re-declared/overridden. At all. I lump this with
visibility, because it's another way of locking down access to an
API; marking something <xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em> is saying, "you cannot extend
this", similar to using <xhtml:em>private</xhtml:em>, but without even the
possibility of redeclaring.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Applied</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>What got me to thinking about all this was a turn of events with
Zend Framework 2. We've had an annotation parser since last summer.
<xhtml:a href="http://ralphschindler.com/">Ralph Schindler</xhtml:a> developed
it in order to facilitate automatic discovery of injection points
for our Dependency Injection container. Classes could mark a method
with the "Inject" annotation, and the various DI compilers would
know that that method needed to be injected.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
use Zend\Di\Definition\Annotation\Inject;

class Foo
{
    protected $bar;

    /**
     * @Inject()
     * @param  Bar $bar
     * @return void
     */
    public function setBar(Bar $bar)
    {
        $this-&gt;bar = $bar;
    }
}

class Bar {}
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>Recently, part of our Forms RFC included a feature to allow
creating forms and their related input filters by using
annotations. Basically, this allows developers to hint on their
domain entities how specific properties should be filtered,
validated, and potentially represented at the form level.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:div class="example">
<xhtml:pre>
<xhtml:code lang="php" xml:lang="php">
use Zend\Form\Annotation;

class Foo
{
    /**
     * @Annotation\Filter({"name":"StringTrim"})
     * @Annotation\Validator({"name":"Between","options":{"min":5,"max":20}})
     * @Annotation\Attributes({"type":"range"})
     */
    protected $bar;
}
</xhtml:code>
</xhtml:pre></xhtml:div>
<xhtml:p>One developer testing the support wanted to use a combination of
<xhtml:a href="http://doctrine-project.org">Doctrine</xhtml:a> annotations and
ZF2 form annotations -- that way his entities could also describe
validation and representation.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I did some work to make this happen, and everybody was happy.
Except then that same developer went to use that entity with
Doctrine, and Doctrine's annotation parser started raising
exceptions on all the ZF2 annotations.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>After some debate, I realized: (a) we were basically just making
up syntax for our annotations; it'd be better to use an established
syntax; but (b) we should still retain the ability to use arbitrary
syntax, as we can't really know what sorts of annotations
developers may already be using.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So, we decided to make our annotation component depend on the
annotations support in Doctrine\\Common, and to use the annotation
syntax they utilize. ZF2 would provide some code to make it
possible to plug in arbitrary parsers, and use the Doctrine\\Common
annotation parser to parse annotations officially supported by
ZF2.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>However, when I went to start making this happen, I ran into
immediate issues.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Remember how this post is about visibility? Well, the class I
was directly interested in,
<xhtml:code>Doctrine\Common\Annotations\DocParser</xhtml:code>, not only
contains private members, but is marked <xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em>.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>My immediate response was to start dissecting the class, cutting
and pasting the bits interesting to my solution into a new class in
ZF2. I went down this route for several hours, gradually pulling in
more and more methods as I discovered how far down the rabbit hole
I needed to go to accomplish my task.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>But at the back of my head, I kept thinking this was a bad idea.
If any patches ever came in for the original class, I'd need to
port them into our ZF2 solution. And I couldn't help but think that
I'd miss a crucial piece.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>So I started playing with its public API, to see if there were
any shortcuts I might be able to take. And there were.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>The class has a public <xhtml:code>parse()</xhtml:code> method. Based on how
Doctrine uses the code, I assumed I needed to pass a full PHP
docblock in -- which ran counter to how I wanted to use the code. I
wanted to pass in an annotation at a time. But when I looked
closer, I realized that the parser didn't require a full docblock;
any fragment would do.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>To make a long story short: I was able to feed the parser a
single annotation at a time from ZF2's
<xhtml:code>AnnotationScanner</xhtml:code>. This allowed me to build a very
simple class that allows registering a set of annotations it can
handle, and feeding it a single annotation string at a time to
decide (a) if it supports it, and (b) to parse it and return the
associated annotation object.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>In sum: because the class in question was marked final and had
private members, I found myself forced to think critically about
what I wanted to accomplish, and then thoroughly understand the
public API to see how I might accomplish that task without the
ability to extend.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:h2>Conclusions</xhtml:h2>
<xhtml:p>Doctrine has a policy that encourages <xhtml:a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke"><xhtml:em>poka-yoke</xhtml:em></xhtml:a>
solutions: code should be executable in a specific way. The policy
was developed to both aid users (having multiple ways of doing
something is often confusing), as well as to ease maintenance
(fewer extension points means less liklihood of developers doing
hard-to-debug things in extending code and reporting it back to the
project). These have led them to heavily use <xhtml:em>private</xhtml:em> and
<xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em> visibility.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I feel that
frameworks and libraries should use <xhtml:em>private</xhtml:em> and
<xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em> sparingly. Over the years, I've seen code repurposed
in simply wondrous ways -- largely due to keeping the code as open
as possible to extension. I like to enable my users as much as
possible.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>That said, I can also see Doctrine's argument -- and can see
where, while it can often be frustrating, it can also lead to
potentially more sound and elegant solutions.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>I'll probably continue shying away from <xhtml:em>private</xhtml:em> and
<xhtml:em>final</xhtml:em> visibility, but I do plan to experiment with it more
in the future. What about you?</xhtml:p>
