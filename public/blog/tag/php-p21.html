    <div class="entry body"><p>
    At work, we've been developing a new platform for our website, based
    entirely on Cgiapp. This week we released the first stage of it: <a href="http://www.garden.org/home">garden.org</a> and <a href="http://assoc.garden.org">assoc.garden.org</a>. These should stand
    as good testament to Cgiapp's robustness!
</p>
<p>
    With all that development, and also with some communication from other
    Cgiapp users, I've made some changes to Cgiapp, and release version 1.5.2
    this evening.
</p>
<p>
    1.5.2 is mainly security and bugfixes. Error handling was somewhat broken in
    1.5.1 -- it wouldn't restore the original error handler gracefully. This is
    now corrected. Additionally, I've made run() use the array returned by
    query() -- consisting of the $_GET and $_POST arrays -- in determining the
    run mode. Finally, I've modified the behaviour of how run() determines the
    current run mode: if the mode parameter is a method or function name, it
    cannot be a Cgiapp method or a PHP internal function. This allows more
    flexibility on the part of the programmer in determining the mode param --
    words like 'run' and 'do' can now be used without causing massive problems
    (using 'run' would cause a race condition in the past).
</p>
<p>
    As usual, Cgiapp is avaiable <a href="download?mode=view_download&id=11">in
        the downloads area</a>. Grab your tarball today!

I don't know why I never bothered to look this up, but I didn't. One thing I
typically do in my parent Cgiapp classes is to pass $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] to
the template. I just found out -- through the pear-general newsgroup -- that
this is unnecessary: use $smarty.server.KEY_NAME to access any $_SERVER vars
your template might need.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    At work this week, I discovered a bug with how I was calling
    set_error_handler() in Cgiapp's run() method. Evidently passing a reference
    in a PHP callback causes issues! So, I corrected that.
</p>
<p>
    I also made a minor, one-character change to query() to make it explicitly
    return a reference to the $_CGIAPP_REQUEST property array.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Cgiapp 1.5 has been released; you may now <a href="download?mode=view_download&id=11">download it</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This release fixes a subtle bug I hadn't encountered before; namely, when a
    method name or function name is passed as an argument to mode_param(), run()
    was receiving the requested run mode... and then attempting to process that
    as the mode param. The behaviour is now fixed, and is actually simpler than
    the previous (non-working) behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    Also, on reading <a href="http://shiflett.org">Chris Shiflet's</a> paper on
    PHP security, I decided to reinstate the query() method. I had been using
    $_REQUEST to check for a run mode parameter; because this combines the GET,
    POST, <b>and</b> COOKIE arrays, it's considered a bit of a security risk.
    query() now creates a combined array of GET and POST variable (POST taking
    precedence over GET) and stores them in the property $_CGIAPP_REQUEST; it
    returns a reference to that property. run() uses that property to determine
    the run mode now.
</p>
<p>
    Enjoy!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been playing with parameter testing in my various Cgiapp classes, and
    one test that seemed pretty slick was the following:
</p>
<pre>
    if (!array_key_exists('some_string', $_REQUEST)) {
        // some error
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Seems pretty straight-forward: $_REQUEST is an associative array, and I want
    to test for the existence of a key in it. Sure, I could use isset(), but it
    seemed...  ugly, and verbose, and a waste of keystrokes, particularly when
    I'm using the param() method:
</p>
<pre>
    if (!isset($_REQUEST[$this->param('some_param')])) {
        // some error
    }
</pre>
<p>
    However, I ran into a pitfall: when it comes to array_key_exists(),
    $_REQUEST isn't exactly an array. I think what's going on is that $_REQUEST
    is actually a superset of several other arrays -- $_POST, $_GET, and
    $_COOKIE -- and isset() has some logic to descend amongst the various keys,
    while array_key_exists() can only work on a single level.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever the explanation, I ended up reverting a bunch of code. :-(

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've standardized my PHP programming to use the environment variable
    <b>SCRIPT_NAME</b> when I want my script to refer to itself in links and
    form actions. I've known that <b>PHP_SELF</b> has the same information, but
    I was more familiar with the name 'SCRIPT_NAME' from using it in perl, and
    liked the feel of it more as it seems to describe the resource better
    ('PHP_SELF' could stand for the path to the PHP executable if I were to go
    by the name only).
</p>
<p>
    However, I just noticed a post on the php.general newsgroup where somebody
    asked what the difference was between them. Semantically, there isn't any;
    they should contain the same information. However, historically and
    technically speaking, there is. <b>SCRIPT_NAME</b> is defined in the CGI 1.1
    specification, and is thus a standard. <em>However</em>, not all web servers
    actually implement it, and thus it isn't necessarily <em>portable</em>.
    <b>PHP_SELF</b>, on the other hand, is implemented directly by PHP, and as
    long as you're programming in PHP, will always be present.
</p>
<p>
    Guess I have some grep and sed in my future as I change a bunch of
    scripts...

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Occasionally, I've needed to process a lot of information from a script, but
    I don't want to worry about PHP timing out or the user aborting the script
    (by clicking on another link or closing the window). Initially, I
    investigated <a href="http://php.net/register_shutdown_function">register_shutdown_function()</a>
    for this; it will fire off a process once the page finishes loading.
    Unfortunately, the process is still a part of the current connection, so it
    can be aborted in the same way as any other script (i.e., by hitting stop,
    closing the browser, going to a new link, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    However, there's another setting initialized via a function that can
    override this behaviour -- i.e., let the script continue running after the
    abort. This is <a href="http://php.net/ignore_user_abort">ignore_user_abort()</a>. By
    setting this to true, your script will continue running after the fact.
</p>
<p>
    This sort of thing would be especially good for bulk uploads where the
    upload needs to be processed -- say, for instance, a group of images or
    email addresses.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/43-Practical-PHP-Programming.html">Practical PHP Programming</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In the past two days, I've seen two references to <a href="http://www.hudzilla.org/php/">Practical PHP Programming</a>, an
    online book that serves both as an introduction to programming with PHP5 and
    MySQL as well as a good advanced reference with many good tips.
</p>
<p>
    This evening, I was browsing through the Performance chapter (chapter 18),
    and found a number of cool things, both for PHP and MySQL. Many were common
    sense things that I've been doing for awhile, but which I've also seen and
    shaken my head at in code I've seen from others (calculating loop
    invariables at every iteration, not using variables passed to a function,
    not returning a value from a function, not using a return value from a
    function). Others were new and gave me pause for thought (string
    concatenation with the '.' operator is expensive, especially when done more
    than once in an operation; echo can take a comma separated list).
</p>
<p>
    Some PHP myths were also dispelled, some of which I've been wondering about
    for awhile. For instance, the amount of comments and whitespace in PHP are
    not a factor in performance (and PHP caching systems will often strip them
    out anyways); double quotes are not more expensive than single quotes unless
    variable interpolation occurs.
</p>
<p>
    It also has some good advice for SQL optimization, and, more importantly,
    MySQL <em>server</em> optimization. For instance, the author suggests
    running 'OPTIMIZE TABLE table;' on any table that has been
    added/updated/deleted from to any large extent since creation; this will
    defrag the table and give it better performance. Use CHAR() versus
    VARCHAR(); VARCHAR() saves on space, but MySQL has to calculate how much
    space was used each time it queries in order to determine where the next
    field or record starts. However, if you have any variable length fields, you
    may as well use as many as you need -- or split off variable length fields
    (such as a TEXT() field) into a different table in order to speed up
    searching. When performing JOINs, compare on numeric fields instead of
    character fields, and always JOIN on rows that are indexed.
</p>
<p>
    I haven't read the entire book, but glancing through the TOC, there are some
    potential downfalls to its content:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It doesn't cover PhpDoc</li>
    <li>It doesn't appear to cover unit testing</li>
    <li>Limited coverage of templating solutions (though they are mentioned)</li>
    <li>Limited usage of PEAR. The author does mention PEAR a number of times,
    and often indicates that use of certain PEAR modules is preferable to using
    the corresponding low-level PHP calls (e.g., Mail and Mail_MIME, DB), but in
    the examples rarely uses them.</li>
    <li>PHP-HTML-PHP... The examples I browsed all created self-contained
    scripts that did all HTML output. While I can appreciate this to a degree,
    I'd still like to see a book that shows OOP development in PHP <em>and which
    creates re-usable web components</em> in doing so. For instance, instead of
    creating a message board <em>script</em>, create a message board
    <em>class</em> that can be called from anywhere with metadata specifying the
    database and templates to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All told, there's plenty of meat in this book -- I wish it were in dead tree
    format already so I could browse through it at my leisure, instead of in
    front of the computer.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/41-Cgiapp-Roadmap.html">Cgiapp Roadmap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a few people contact me indicating interest in Cgiapp, and I've
    noticed a number of subscribers to the freshmeat project I've setup. In
    addition, we're using the library extensively at the <a href="http://www.garden.org">National Gardening Association</a> in
    developing our new site (the current site is using a mixture of ASP and
    Tango, with several newer applications using PHP). I've also been monitoring
    the CGI::Application mailing list. As a result of all this activity, I've
    decided I need to develop a roadmap for Cgiapp.
</p>
<p>Currently, planned changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Version 1.x series:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a Smarty registration for stripslashes (the Smarty
            "function" call will be sslashes).</li>
            <li>param() bugfix: currently, calling param() with no arguments
            simply gives you a list of parameters registered with the method,
            but not their values; this will be fixed.</li>
            <li>error_mode() method. The CGI::Application ML brought up and
            implemented the idea of an error_mode() method to register
            an error_mode with the object (similar to run_modes()). While
            non-essential, it would offer a standard, built-in hook for error
            handling.</li>
            <li>$PATH_INFO traversing. Again, on the CGI::App ML, a request was
            brought up for built-in support for using $PATH_INFO to determine
            the run mode. Basically, you would pass a parameter indicating which
            location in the $PATH_INFO string holds the run mode.</li>
            <li>DocBook tutorials. I feel that too much information is given in
            the class-level documentation, and that usage tutorials need to be
            written. Since I'm documenting with PhpDoc and targetting PEAR,
            moving tutorials into DocBook is a logical step.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Version 2.x series:</b><br>
        Yes, a Cgiapp2 is in the future. There are a few changes that are either
        necessitating (a) PHP5, or (b) API changes. In keeping with PEAR
        guidelines, I'll rename the module Cgiapp2 so as not to break
        applications designed for Cgiapp.<br><br>
        Changes expected include:
        <ul>
            <li>Inherit from PEAR. This will allow for some built in error
            handling, among other things. I suspect that this will tie in with
            the error_mode(), and may also deprecate croak() and carp().</li>
            <li>Changes to tmpl_path() and load_tmpl(). In the perl version, you
            would instantiate a template using load_tmpl(), assign your
            variables to it, and then do your fetch() on it. So, this:
                <pre>
$this->tmpl_assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
                </pre>
            Becomes this:
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl();
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch('template.html');
                </pre>
            OR
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch();
                </pre>
            (Both examples assume use of Smarty.) I want to revert to
            this behaviour for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Portability with perl. This is one area in which the PHP
                    and perl versions differ greatly; going to the perl way
                    makes porting classes between the two languages
                    simpler.</li>
                    <li>Decoupling. The current set of template methods create
                    an object as a parameter of the application object - which
                    is fine, unless the template object instantiator returns an
                    object of a different kind.</li>
                </ul>
            Cons:
                <ul>
                     <li>Smarty can use the same object to fill multiple
                     templates, and the current methods make use of this. By
                     assigning the template object locally to each method, this
                     could be lost.<br><br>
                     HOWEVER... an easy work-around would be for load_tmpl() to
                     create the object and store it an a parameter; subsequent
                     calls would return the same object reference. The
                     difficulty then would be if load_tmpl() assumed a template
                     name would be passed.  However, even in CGI::App, you
                     decide on a template engine and design for that engine;
                     there is never an assumption that template engines should
                     be swappable.</li>
                     <li>Existing Cgiapp1 applications would need to be
                     rewritten.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Plugin Architecture:</b>
                The CGI::App ML has produced a ::Plugin namespace that utilizes
                a common plugin architecture. The way it is done in perl is
                through some magic of namespaces and export routines... both of
                which are, notably, missing from PHP.<br><br>
                However, I think I may know a workaround for this, if I use
                PHP5: the magic __call() overloader method.<br><br>
                My idea is to have plugin classes register methods that should
                be accessible by a Cgiapp-based class a special key in the
                $_GLOBALS array.  Then, the __call() method would check the
                key for registered methods; if one is found matching a method
                requested, that method is called (using call_user_func()), with
                the Cgiapp-based object reference as the first reference. Voila!
                instant plugins!<br><br>
                Why do this? A library of 'standard' plugins could then be
                created, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A form validation plugin</li>
                    <li>Alternate template engines as plugins (instead of
                    overriding the tmpl_* methods)</li>
                    <li>An authorization plugin</li>
                </ul>
                Since the 'exported' methods would have access to the Cgiapp
                object, they could even register objects or parameters with it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
