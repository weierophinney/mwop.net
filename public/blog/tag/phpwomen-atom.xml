wrapup</xhtml:a> was my involvement with the <xhtml:a href="http://www.phpwomen.org/">phpwomen booth</xhtml:a>. <xhtml:a href="http://www.khankennels.com/blog/">Lig</xhtml:a> emailed me some months
in advance asking if I'd be an official "booth babe" while at the
conference -- basically wearing a T-shirt to show my support of the
movement, and answering any questions that others might have
regarding it. While I haven't been particularly active with
phpwomen, I of course agreed.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>As <xhtml:a href="http://www.lornajane.net/">Lorna Jane</xhtml:a> noted,
there were <xhtml:em>very</xhtml:em> few women at the conference. I'd say
estimating them at 2% of total attendees would very much be a
stretch. Also very strange was how little interest the phpwomen
booth attracted -- during those times I was at the booth, we'd get
a few people coming forward, but not many... and very few males.
This is very much in contrast to my observations at ZendCon last
year, when there were almost constantly folks at the booth, and
dozens of males were wearing the phpwomen t-shirts throughout the
conference.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>That said, one very funny picture came out of my participation,
snapped by <xhtml:a href="http://www.leftontheweb.com/">Stefan</xhtml:a>:</xhtml:p>

<xhtml:p>I think it speaks for itself, no? :-)</xhtml:p>
