    I've been wanting to do screencasts on Linux for some time now, and my big
    stumbling block has been determining what tools to use.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>tl;dr</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Use <code>recordMyDesktop</code> to record video clips, but afterwards, re-encode them
        to AVI (<a href="#script">see the script I used</a>)
    </li>

    <li>
        Record audio to WAV, or convert compressed audio to WAV format afterwards.
    </li>

    <li>
        Use OpenShot to stitch clips together and layer audio and video tracks.
    </li>

    <li>
        Remember to reset the video length if you change the playback rate.
    </li>

    <li>
        Export to a Web + Vimeo profile for best results.
    </li>

    We're working on migrating <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend
        Framework</a> to <a href="http://git-scm.org/">Git</a>. One issue we're
    trying to deal with is enforcing that commits come from <acronym
        title="Contributor License Agreement">CLA</acronym> signees.
</p>

<p>
    One possibility presented to us was the possibility of utilizing
    <acronym title="GNU Privacy Guard">GPG</acronym> signing of commit messages.
    Unfortunately, I was able to find little to no information on the 'net about
    how this might be done, so I started to experiment with some solutions.
</p>

<p>
    The approach I chose utilizes <a
        href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html">git
        hooks</a>, specifically the <code>commit-msg</code> hook client-side,

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been using <a
        href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a> for
    some time now, and appreciate how easy it makes both connecting to wifi as
    well as VPNs. That said, I've had an issue with it that I only resolved
    today.
</p>

<p>
    When working from home, I prefer to use a VPN split tunnel setup -- I'm
    behind a firewall all the time, and it's useful to be able to run virtual
    machines while still connected to my VPN (e.g., when doing training or
    webinar sessions). However, I noticed some months ago that this wasn't
    working. I assumed at first it was a change in our network setup, but others
    reported that the split tunnel was working fine. It's been particularly
    problematic when on IRC -- if the VPN drops, I lose my IRC connection,
    meaning I have to re-connect and re-claim my nick.
</p>

<p>
    So, I did some searching, and found an interesting setting. In
    NetworkManager, "Configure..." then "Edit" your VPN connection,
    and navigate to the "IPv4 Settings" tab. Once there, click the button that
    says "Routes..." and select the checkbox next to "Use this connection only
    for resources on its network". Press Ok to close the dialog, then "Apply" to
    exit out of the VPN configuration. Re-connect to the VPN, and you should be
    all set.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Note: this will only work if your VPN server is configured to allow
    split tunnels. Additionally, only do so if you are behind a firewall.
    Practice safe networking.</em>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    My good friend, Rob, hosts my site for me, in return for helping with server
    maintenance. After being on Gentoo for the past three years, though, we
    decided it was time to switch to something a little easier to maintain, so
    last night we wiped the system partitions and installed Ubuntu server.
</p>

<p>
    I'll say this: the setup is much faster! However, we had a few gotchas that
    surprised us -- it didn't setup our RAID array out-of-the-box, which led to
    a good hour of frustration as we tried to verify that the install wouldn't
    wipe it, and then to verify that we could re-assemble it.  (We succeeded.)
    Additionally, we second-guessed a few things we shouldn't have, which led to
    needing to back out and reconfigure. But what was over a 12 hour install
    with Gentoo we accomplished in a matter of a few hours with Ubuntu server --
    so it was a huge success that way.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, our mysqldump of all databases... wasn't, a fact we
    discovered only after importing it into the new system. I ended up losing my
    blog database and PEAR channel database. Fortunately, the PEAR channel
    has not changed at all in the past year, so we had an old backup that
    worked, and I had a snapshot of my blog database from three weeks ago I was
    able to use. As a result, there are a few missing entries, but for the most
    part, all works. If you commented on one of those missing entries, my
    apologies.
</p>

<p>
    Now that the install is done, I'm also finalizing some design changes to my
    blog -- it's time to leave the black and white for more colorful grounds.
    Look for a revamp in the coming weeks!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In an effort to debug issues on a cluster, I was trying to determine which
    machine on the cluster was causing the issue. My idea was that I could
    insert a header token identifying the server.
</p>

<p>
    My first idea was to add the directive 'Header add X-Server-Ip
    "%{SERVER_ADDR}e" in my httpd.conf. However, due to the nature of our load
    balancer, Apache was somehow resolving this to the load balancer IP address
    on all machines of the cluster -- which was really, really not useful.
</p>

<p>
    I finally stumbled on a good solution, however: you can set environment
    variables in apachectl, and then pass them into the Apache environment using
    the PassEnv directive from mod_env; once that's done, you can use the
    environment variable anywhere.
</p>

<p>
    In my apachectl, I added the line "export HOSTNAME=`hostname`". Then, in my
    httpd.conf, I added first the line "PassEnv HOSTNAME", followed by the
    directive 'Header add X-Server-Name "%{HOSTNAME}e"'. Voila! I now had the
    hostname in the header, which gave me the information I needed for
    debugging.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    A little over a year ago, <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/101-Using-Windows-XP.html">I stopped using Linux as my primary desktop</a> 
    due to the fact that a number of programs we were using were Windows
    dependent. Despite 
    <a href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/103-XP-+-Cygwin-+-coLinux-Productivity.html">getting coLinux running</a>,
    I've never been completely satisfied with the setup. I missed being able to
    paste with my middle-mouse button, and I was constantly having character
    encoding issues pasting back and forth between PuTTY and windows apps,
    couldn't access mail easily between my coLinux and Windows partitions, and
    overall felt that I was losing out on some productivity by not having a
    native linux environment as my primary OS.
</p>
<p>
    Last week, we had an infrastructure change at work, and I basically realized
    that my Windows + coLinux setup was going to get in the way of productivity
    -- and that, at this point, there were now Windows applications tying me to
    that OS. So, I decided it was time to go back to Linux.
