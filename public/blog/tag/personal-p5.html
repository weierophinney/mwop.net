    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've used HTML::Template a little, mainly in the Secret Santa project I did
    this past Christmas for my wife's family. One thing I disliked was using the
    normal syntax: &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME=IMAGE_SRC&gt; -- it made looking at it
    difficult (it wasn't always easy to tell what was an HTML tag, what was
    plain text, and what was HTML::Template stuff), and it made it impossible to
    validate my pages before they had data.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, there's an alternate syntax: wrap the syntax in HTML comments:
    &lt;!-- TMPL_VAR NAME=IMAGE_SRC --&gt; does the job. It uses more
    characters, true, but it gets highlighted different than HTML tags, as well,
    and that's worth a lot.
</p>
<p>
    And why do I have to say "NAME=" every time? That gets annoying. As it turns
    out, I can simply say: &lt;!-- TMPL_VAR IMAGE_SRC --&gt;, and that, too will
    get the job done.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, what about those times when I want to define a template, but have
    it broken into parts, too? Basically, I want HTML::Template to behave a
    little like SSI. No worries; there's a TMPL_INCLUDE tag that can do this:
    &lt;!-- TMPL_INCLUDE NAME="filename.tmpl" --&gt;.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been reading a lot of posts lately on the CGI::App mailing list about
    using CGI::Application::ValidateRM (RM == Run Mode); I finally went and
    checked it out.
</p>
    CGI::App::ValRM uses Data::FormValidator in order to do its magic.
    Interestingly, D::FV is built much like how I've buit our formHandlers
    library at work -- you specify a list of required fields, and a list of
    fields that need to be validated against criteria, then provide the
    criteria. It goes exactly how I would have done our libraries had we been
    working in perl -- supplying the constraint as a regexp or anonymous sub in
    a hashref for the field.

<p>
    Anyways, it looks like the combination of CGI::App::ValRM with CGI::App
    could greatly simplify any form validations I need to do on the site, which
    will in turn make me very happy!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I had some success last night with the My::Portal CGI::Application
    superclass I'm building -- I actually got it working with CGI::Wiki::Simple
    (after I debugged the latter to fix some delegation issues!). Now that I
    know the "proof-of-concept" works, I'm ready to start in on some other
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    The first issue is: how can I specify different directories for different
    applications to search for templates, while retaining the default directory
    so that the superclass can build the final page? I <em>could</em> always
    simply keep all templates in a single directory and simply prefix them, but
    that seems inelegant, somehow. I'll need to explore how HTML::Template
    integration works with CGI::App.
</p>
<p>
    Second, and closely related: how do I want it to look, in the end? I could
    see keeping the design we have -- it's clean, simple, and yet somehow
    functionally elegant. Okay, I'm exaggerating -- it's your standard
    three-column with header and footer. But it goes with the idea of blocks of
    content. I need to think about that.
</p>
<p>
    I saw a design idea for a WikiWikiWeb today, though, that totally changed my
    ideas of how a Wiki should look. I hadn't been to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> for some time,
    but a Google link to Gaston Julia showed up on Slashdot as it shut down a
    site in Australia, and so I visited it. I <em>like</em> the new design -- it
    separates out the common links needed into a nice left menu, and puts
    a subset of that at the top and bottom of the main column as well, using
    nice borders to visually separate things. I much prefer it to PhpWiki's
    default style, as well as to anything else I've really seen so far relating
    to Wiki layout.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had occasion to need to grab a specific set of files from a large
    directory -- most recently, I needed to grab some specific access logs from
    our Apache logfiles at work.
</p>
<p>
    Enter <kbd>find</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
    I needed to get all files newer than a specific date, and with the pattern
    'sitename-access_log.timestamp.gz'. I then needed to tar up these files and
    grab them for processing. So, here's what I did:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <kbd>-newer filename</kbd> tells find to locate files newer than
        filename.
    </li>
    <li>The <kbd>-regex</kbd> flag tells find to locate files matching the
        regular expression. The regex that find uses is a little strange,
        however, and didn't follow many conventions I know; for one thing, it's
        assumed that the pattern you write will match against the entire string,
        and not just a portion of it. What I ended up using was 
        <kbd>-regex '.*access_log.*gz'</kbd>, and that worked.
    </li>
    <li>The <kbd>-printf</kbd> flag tells find to format the printing. This is
        useful when using the output of find in another program. For instance,
        tar likes a list of filenames... so I used <kbd>printf "%p "</kbd>,
        which separated each filename with a space.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I then backticked my full find statement and used it as the final argument
    to a tar command; voila! instant tar file with the files I need!

    I've been struggling with how to use modules at runtime instead of compile
    time (I even wrote about this once before). I finally figured it out:
</p>
<pre>my $module = "ROX::Filer";
eval "use $module";
die "couldn't load module : $!n" if ($@);
</pre>
<p>
    Now I just need to figure out how to create objects from dynamic module
    names...!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/21-ClassDBI.html">Class::DBI</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was reading a thread on the cgiapp mailing list today from several of the
    core developers about developing a book on CGI::Application. In it, several
    mentioned that it might/should center around CGI::App and a handful of
    oft-used modules. One of those modules is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Etmtm/Class-DBI-0.95/lib/Class/DBI.pm">Class::DBI</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I took a gander at Class::DBI over at CPAN, and it looks absolutely amazing,
    and at the same time perhaps too abstract. Basically, you create a number of
    packages and/or packages, one for each table you'll be using in your
    application, and one to establish your basic connection. Then, each package
    creates an object instance of the connection, and defines a number of
    properties: the name of the table, the columns you'll be using, and then the
    relations it has to other tables (<tt>has_a( col_name =>
        'Package::Name'); has_many( col_name => 'Package::Name');
        might_have(col_name => 'Package::Name');</tt>) etc.
</p>
<p>
    Then you use the module/packages you need in your script, and you can then
    use object-oriented notation to do things like insert rows, update rows,
    search a table, select rows, etc. And it looks fairly natural.
</p>
<p>
    I like the idea of data abstraction like this. I see a couple issues,
    however:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>I don't like the idea of one package per table; that gets so abstract as
    to make development come to a stand-still, especially during initial
    development. However, once development is sufficiently advanced, I could see
    doing this, particularly for large projects; it could vastly simplify many
    regular DBI calls.</li>
    <li>I <strong>like</strong> using SQL. If I need to debug why something
    isn't working when I interact with the database, I want to have absolute
    control over the language. Abstracting the SQL means I don't have that
    fine-grained control that helps me debug.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    So, for now, I'll stick with straight DBI... but this is an interesting
    avenue to explore.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Due to my cursory reading in the <em>Perl Cookbook, 2nd Edition</em>,
    earlier this week, I've been investigating the <tt>use autouse</tt> pragma,
    to see if it will indeed solve my issue of wanting to use different modules
    based on the current situation. Unfortunately, I cannot find any
    documentation on it in <tt>perldoc</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    I remember seeing something about wrapping this stuff into a <tt>BEGIN</tt>
    block, but that would require knowing certain information immediately, and I
    might need the code to work through some steps before getting there.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=323606">this
        node</a> just appeared on Perl Monks today, and I got to see other ways
    of doing it:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <tt>if</tt> module lets you do something like <tt>use if $type eq
        'x', "Some::Module";</tt> However, $type must be known at compile time
        (i.e., it's based on system info or on @ARGV); this probably wouldn't
        work in a web-based application.
    </li>
    <li>Use <tt>require</tt> and <tt>import</tt> instead: <tt>if $type wq 'ex')
        { require Some::Module; Some::Module->import if
        Some::Module->can("import"); }</tt> If your module doesn't export
        anything, you can even omit the call to <tt>import</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>Use an <tt>eval</tt>: <tt>if ($type eq 'x') { eval "use Some::Module";
        }</tt> This gets around the <tt>import</tt> problem, but could possibly
        run into other compile time issues.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    So, basically, I already had the tools to do the job; just needed to examine
    the problem more.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    So, I'm a bit of an idiot... it's been so long since I looked at CGI::App,
    and yet I felt I had such a grasp on it, that I overlooked the obvious step:
    look at the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Ejerlbaum/CGI-Application-3.1/Application.pm">manual!</a>
</p>
<p>
    In particular, there's a whole series of methods that are used to tailor
    CGI:App to your particular needs, and these include <em>cgiapp_init(),
        cgiapp_prerun(), and cgiapp_postrun()</em>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>cgiapp_init()</b> is used to perform application specific
        initialization behaviour, and is called immediately before the setup()
        method. It can be used to load settings from elsewhere; if it were
        called only from a superclass from which other modules inherited, it
        would then provide common settings for all modules.
    </li>
    <li><b>cgiapp_prerun()</b> is called immediately before the selected
        run-mode. If it were called only by your superclass, you could perform
        items such as authorization or even form validation; this would then be
        standard for all your applications. (You can use the
        $self->prerun_mode('mode') call to to override the selected run-mode,
        for instance, thus allowing you to redirect to a different mode if a
        user isn't permitted there.)
    </li>
    <li><b>cgiapp_postrun()</b> is called after the run-mode has returned its
        output, but before http headers have been generated or anything sent to
        the web browser. Again, if defined in a superclass, it means that you
        could then place the run-mode output <em>in a specific place within a
            larger template</em>, and even call other routines to fill in other
        parts of the main template. You could even check to see if certain
        parameters were passed to the page, and change the type of output you
        send back (XML, PDF, image, etc.), allowing you to have a common query
        element that changes the output type (e.g., a 'print' parameter that
        returns a PDF or a stripped down template).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, you could specify in the superclass that you're using
    CGI::Simple for the query object (using the <em>cgiapp_get_query</em>
    method), or you could rewrite the <em>load_tmpl()</em> method to use
    Template::Toolkit or some other templating system, etc.

    Doesn't look so crazy anymore...
