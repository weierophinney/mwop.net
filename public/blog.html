    RESTful APIs have been an interest of mine for a couple of years, but due
    to <a href="http://framework.zend.com/blog//zend-framework-2-0-0-stable-released.html">circumstances</a>,
    I've not had much chance to work with them in any meaningful fashion until
    recently.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</a> and I proposed a workshop for
    <a href="http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2013/">PHP Benelux 2013</a> 
    covering RESTful APIs with ZF2. When it was accepted, it gave me the perfect
    opportunity to dive in and start putting the various pieces together.

    As an experiment, I migrated my website over to <a 
    href="http://openshift.redhat.com">OpenShift</a> yesterday. I've been hosting
    a pastebin there already, and have found the service to be both straightforward
    and flexible; it was time to put it to a more thorough test.
</p>

<p>
    In the process, I ran into a number of interesting issues, some of which took quite
    some time to resolve; this post is both to help inform other potential users of the
    service, as well as act as a reminder to myself.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/2012-12-20-on-shared-interfaces.html">On php-fig and Shared Interfaces</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    This is a post I've been meaning to write for a long time, and one requested
    of me personally by <a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/blog/">Evert 
    Pot</a> during the Dutch PHP Conference in June 2012. It details some observations
    I have of php-fig, and hopefully will serve as a record of why I'm not
    directly participating any longer.
</p>

<p>
    I was a founding member of the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/">Framework 
    Interoperability Group</a>, now called "php-fig". I was one of around a dozen 
    folks who sat around a table in 2009 in Chicago during php|tek and started 
    discussions about what we could all do to make it possible to work better 
    together between our projects, and make it simpler for users to pick and choose 
    from our projects in order to build the solutions to their own problems.
</p>

<p>
    The first "standard" that came from this was <a 
    href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a>, 
    which promoted a standard class naming convention that uses a 1:1 relationship 
    between the namespace and/or vendor prefix and the directory hierarchy, and the 
    class name and the filename in which it lives. To this day, there are both 
    those who hail this as a great step forward for cooperation, and simultaneously 
    others who feel it's a terrible practice. 
</p>

<p>
    And then nothing, for years. But a little over a year ago, there was a new 
    push by a number of folks wanting to do more. Paul Jones did a remarkable 
    job of spearheading the next <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md">two</a> 
    <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">standards</a>, 
    which centered around coding style. Again, just like with PSR-0, we had 
    both those feeling it was a huge step forward, and those who loathe the 
    direction.
</p>

<p>
    What was interesting, though, was that once we started seeing some new energy
    and momentum, it seemed that <em>everyone</em> wanted a say. And we started 
    getting dozens of folks a week asking to be voting members, and new proposal
    after new proposal. Whether or not somebody likes an existing standard, they
    want to have backing for a standard they propose.
</p>

<p>
    And this is when we started seeing proposals surface for shared interfaces, first
    around caching, and now around logging (though the latter is the first up for
    vote).

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    <a href="http://blog.calevans.com">Cal Evans</a> has organized another 
    DayCamp4Developers event, this time entitled "<a 
    href="http://blog.calevans.com/2012/11/19/php-master-series-vol-1">PHP 
    Master Series, Volume 1</a>". I'm honored to be an invited speaker for this 
    first edition, where I'll be presenting my talk, "Designing Beautiful Software".
</p>

<p>
    Why would you want to participate? Well, for one, because you can interact directly
    with the various speakers during the presentations. Sure, you can likely find the slide
    decks elsewhere, or possibly even recordings. But if we all do our jobs right, we'll
    likely raise more questions than answers; if you attend, you'll get a chance to ask
    some of your questions immediately, <em>and we may even answer them!</em>
</p>

<p>
    On top of that, this is a fantastic lineup of speakers, and, frankly, not a lineup 
    I've ever participated in. In a typical conference, you'd likely see one or two of
    us, and be lucky if we weren't scheduled against each other; if you attend 
    this week, you'll get to see us all, back-to-back. 
</p>

<p>
    What else will you be doing this Friday, anyways, while <a 
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">you wait for the end of the 
    world?</a>
</p>

<p>
    So, do yourself a favor, and <a 
    href="http://phpmasterseriesv1.eventbrite.com/">register today</a>!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Once again, I spoke at <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">ZendCon</a> 
    this year; in talking with <a href="http://twitter.com/chwenz">Christian Wenz</a>,
    we're pretty sure that the two of us and <a href="http://andigutmans.blogspot.com">Andi</a>
    are the only ones who have spoken at all eight events.
</p>

<p>
    Unusually for me, I did not speak on a Zend Framework topic, and had
    only one regular slot (I also co-presented a Design Patterns tutorial
    with my team). That slot, however, became one of my favorite talks I've
    delivered: "Designing Beautiful Software". I've given this talk a couple
    times before, but I completely rewrote it for this conference in order 
    to better convey my core message: beautiful software is maintainable
    and extensible; writing software is a craft.
</p>

    I discovered today that not only was it recorded, but it's been <a href="http://youtu.be/mQsQ6QZ4dGg">posted

    Zend Server has a very cool
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch_v=i2XXn2SA5zM.html" target="_blank">Page Caching feature</a>. Basically, you can provide
    URLs or URL regular expressions, and tell Zend Server to provide full-page
    caching of those pages. This can provide a tremendous performance boost, without
    needing to change anything in your application structure; simply enable it for a
    set of pages, and sit back and relax.

I was recently shopping around for inexpensive cloud hosting; I want to try out
a couple of ideas that may or may not have much traffic, but which aren't suited
for my VPS setup (the excellent <a href="http://servergrove.com/">ServerGrove</a>); additionally, I'm unsure how long
I will maintain these projects. My budget for this is quite small as a result;
I'm already paying for hosting, and am quite happy with it, so this is really
for experimental stuff.
</p>

<p>
I considered Amazon, Orchestra.io, and a few others, but was concerned about the
idea of a ~$50/month cost for something I'm uncertain about. 
</p>

<p>
When I asked in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/zftalk.dev">#zftalk.dev</a>, someone
suggested <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com/">OpenShift</a> as an idea, and
coincidentally, the very next day
<a href="http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/press/379_red-hat-expands-openshift-ecosystem-with-zend-partnership-to-offer-professional-grade-environment-for-php-developers">Zend announced a partnership with RedHat surrounding OpenShift</a>.  The stars were in alignment.
</p>

<p>
In the past month, in the few spare moments I've had (which included an
excellent OpenShift hackathon at ZendCon), I've created a quick application that
I've deployed and tested in OpenShift. These are my findings.

    I've been wanting to do screencasts on Linux for some time now, and my big
    stumbling block has been determining what tools to use.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>tl;dr</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Use <code>recordMyDesktop</code> to record video clips, but afterwards, re-encode them
        to AVI (<a href="#script">see the script I used</a>)
    </li>

    <li>
        Record audio to WAV, or convert compressed audio to WAV format afterwards.
    </li>

    <li>
        Use OpenShot to stitch clips together and layer audio and video tracks.
    </li>

    <li>
        Remember to reset the video length if you change the playback rate.
    </li>

    <li>
        Export to a Web + Vimeo profile for best results.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
One of the exciting features of the newly released Zend Framework 2 is the new
module system.
</p>

<p>
While ZF1 had modules, they were difficult to manage. All resources for all
modules were initialized on each request, and bootstrapping modules was an
onerous task. Due to the difficulties, modules were never truly "plug-and-play",
and thus no ecosystem ever evolved for sharing modules.
</p>

<p>
In Zend Framework 2, we've architected the MVC from the ground up to make
modular applications as easy as possible. Within ZF2, the MVC simply cares about
events and services — and controllers are simply one kind of service. As such,
modules are primarily about telling the MVC about services and wiring event
listeners.
</p>

<p>
To give you an example, in this tutorial, I'll show you how to install the Zend
Framework 2 skeleton application, and we'll then install a module and see how
easy it is to add it to the application and then configure it.

    <li>Using small things that work together to solve larger problems.</li>
