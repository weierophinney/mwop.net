Last Wednesday, I presented a webinar for Zend entitled "MVC applications with
Zend Framework". We had more than 50 attendees, most of whom stayed on the whole
time. For those of you who attended, thanks for the great questions and
comments.

If you would like to view the webinar, download the slides, or download the
example code (a hello world app), visit the [Zend.com Webinar page](http://www.zend.com/webinar)
and look for the presentation; as of today, it's the first one on the list, but
that will change as more webinars are presented.
