Almost two years ago, I was contacted by [Zend](http://www.zend.com/) about a
job opportunity, and mid-September of that year started working for Zend
full-time in its new eBiz group, responsible for maintenance and development of
its websites and web services.

A little over a year ago, [Andi](http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/)
[asked me to assume the role of lead developer on the Zend Framework MVC components](/blog/129-MVC-changes-in-Zend-Framework.html),
which kicked off my first major involvement in Zend Framework. Since then, I
have been maintaining the MVC components and a handful of others (such as the
server components, mail, and JSON) in addition to my day-to-day duties on the
eBiz team.

A few weeks ago, my supervisor, Boaz, approached me to tell me that Andi had
requested for me to transfer full-time to the Zend Framework team. After some
thought, I agreed to the move. I will stay on the ebiz team for the next couple
of months to help finish out some projects, but will then transition to
full-time involvement with the Zend Framework team. This will afford me more
time to work on tutorials and articles covering Zend Framework, as well as more
dedicated time to work on the components I own.

Many thanks to all who have supported and encouraged me the past couple years,
and particularly to those I've worked with on a day-to-day basis â€” you know who
you are. Here's looking to a rosy future with Zend Framework!
