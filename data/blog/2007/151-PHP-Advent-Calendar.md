When [Chris Shifflet](http://shiflett.org/) contacted me about his idea for the
[PHP Advent Calendar](http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/dec), I was intrigued; I've
occasionally seen entries for the [Perl Advent Calendar](http://www.perladvent.org/),
and found them uniformly interesting. So far, I've very much enjoyed the entries
this year, and have been especially thrilled to see some well-known bloggers
blogging on topics we don't normally see them discuss.

Hopefully [my entry](http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/dec/php-advent-calendar-day-8)
strikes a chord with someone; best of the holiday seasons to all of you!
