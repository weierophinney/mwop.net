This past Wednesday, [Zend's](http://www.zend.com/) Chief Marketing Officer,
[Mark de Visser](http://blogs.zend.com/author/mark/), and myself joined the
[NYPHP](http://nyphp.org/) group for a [special event meeting](http://nyphp.org/content/calendar/view_entry.php?id=112&date=20070912).
Mark presented information on Zend's development stack and toolset (which I
entirely missed, as I was still in transit), and I came in to give an overview
of [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/).

There were some great questions, and nice discussions following the event. If
you live in New York and do PHP for a living, and haven't attended, you should;
if you're ever visiting the area, see if you can attend a meeting!

[Here are the slides.](/uploads/FrameworkPresentation.zip "FrameworkPresentation.zip")
They're done using [S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/), a browser-based
slideshow system.  Simply unzip and double-click on `index.html` to start viewing.
