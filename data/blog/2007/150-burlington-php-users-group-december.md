I've been considering for a good six months trying to organize a PHP Users Group
for the Burlington, VT, area. When we first moved to Vermont, I was surprised
(and excited) by the number of PHP shops (which at the time I saw as job
potential, as I was looking for work), and actually walked my resume around to a
half-dozen or so. The area has a ton of PHP developers, and it only makes sense
to have a UG where we can exchange tips and tricks of the trade.

Then, about six weeks ago, I mentioned this to my friend Rob. He did what I
should have done all along, and googled for an existing group â€” and found one!

The [Burlington, VT PHP Users Group](http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP)
has been around since November of 2005 on Google Groups, but we're having our
inaugural meeting this coming Wednesday, 5 December 2007. I'll be speaking at
this first meeting on Zend Framework's MVC components

If you're in the Burlington area this Wednesday, you should stop by. For more
details, [visit the event page](http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP/web/meeting-2007-12-05),
and don't forget to RSVP.
