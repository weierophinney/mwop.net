I don't know why I haven't blogged this sooner, but, yes, I'll be speaking once
again at [ZendCon:](http://www.zendcon.com/)

[![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/zendcon/ZendCon07_SpeakerBadge.gif)](http://www.zend.com.com)

I'll be presenting a number of times:

- On Monday, I join [Sebastian Bergmann](http://sebastian-bergmann.de/) and
  [Mike Naberezny](http://naberezny.com/) in a full-day tutorial session on PHP
  Development Best Practices and Unit Testing. This expands on what Mike and I
  did last year, and will more heavily emphasize the role of testing in the
  development process â€” arguably the most important best practice you can
  adopt.
- On Tuesday monrning, I'll present a Zend Framework MVC Quick Start. This talk
  is based on a [webinar](/blog/144-Zend-Framework-MVC-Webinar-posted.html)
  I recently gave for Zend, and covers the various pieces of the MVC layer in
  Zend Framework.
- Tuesday evening, I'll present an
  [Unconference](http://zendcon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Uncon) session on
  Ajax-enabling your Zend Framework controllers. I don't know yet if I'll need
  the whole hour, but I can probably fill it up with some examples of decorating
  your apps with AJAX.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
