So, in addition to it being my daughter's birthday, which is exciting enough in
itself, I received a package from my publisher,
[SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com), with my author copies of
[The PHP Anthology](http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phpant2/). Very exciting to
see stuff I've written published!
