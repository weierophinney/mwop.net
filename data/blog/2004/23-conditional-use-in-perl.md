I've been struggling with how to use modules at runtime instead of compile time (I even wrote about this once before). I finally figured it out:

```perl
my $module = "ROX::Filer";
eval "use $module";
die "couldn't load module : $!n" if ($@);
```

Now I just need to figure out how to create objects from dynamic module namesâ€¦!

**Update:** Creating objects from dynamic names is as easy as dynamically loading the module at run-time:

```perl
my $obj = $module->new();
```
