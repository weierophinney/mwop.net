It's now been confirmed: I'm a geek.

Okay, so that probably comes as no shocker to those of you who know me, but it's
the little things that make me realize it myself.

I've been frequenting [Perl Monks](http://www.perlmonks.org) for a couple of
years now, mainly to garner ideas and code to help me with my personal or work
projects. I rarely post comments, and I've only once submitted a question to the
site. However, I **do** frequent the site regularly, and the few comments I've
put in — generally regarding usage of
[CGI::Application](http::/search.cpan.org/search?query=CGI%3A%3AApplication) —
have been typically well-moderated.

Well, yesterday I [made a comment](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408255) to
a user [asking about editors to use with perl](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408231).
I was incensed by a remark he made about [VIM](http://www.vim.org) not having
the features he needed. Now, as I said in my comment, I've used VIM on a daily
basis for over two years, and I'm *still* discovering new features — and I've
used all of the features he was looking for.

This is where I discovered I'm a geek: my comment made it into the
[Daily Best](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=Best%20Nodes) for today, peaking
around number 5. The fact that that made my day indicates to me that I *must* be
a geek.

Oh — and VIM rules!
