The new weierophinney.net/matthew/ site is now up and running!

The site has been many months in planning, and about a month or so in actual coding. I have written the site in, instead of flatfiles, PHP, so as to:

- Allow easier updating (it includes its own content management system)
- Include a blog for my web development and IT interests
- Allow site searching (everything is an article or download)

I've written it using a strict MVC model, which means that I have libraries for
accessing and manipulating the database; all displays are template driven
(meaning I can create them with plain-old HTML); and I can create customizable
applications out of various controller libraries. I've called this concoction
**Dragonfly**.

There will be more developments coming â€” sitewide search comes to mind, as well
as RSS feeds for the blog and downloads.

Stay Tuned!
