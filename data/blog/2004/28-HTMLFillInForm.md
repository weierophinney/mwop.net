The `CGI::Application::ValidateRM` module utilizes `HTML::FillInForm` to fill in
values in the form if portions did not pass validation. Basically, it utilizes
`HTML::Parser` to go through and find the elements and match them to values.
It's used because the assumption is that you've built your form into an
`HTML::Template`, and that way you don't need to put in program logic into the
form.

Seems another good candidate for using `FillInForm` would be to populate a form
with values grabbed from a databaseâ€¦ I should look into that as well!
