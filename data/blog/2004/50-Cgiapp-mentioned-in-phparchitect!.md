A new [Cgiapp](download?mode=view&id=11) user reported they had stumbled across
the project in [php|architect](http://www.phparch.com)! It's in the current,
October 2004 issue, in the News section, prominently displayed in the upper
right corner of the page. The announcement blurb is straight from my
[freshmeat project page](http://freshmeat.net/projects/cgiapp/) for version 1.4.
Cgiapp is carving a name for itself!
