Once again, I spoke at [ZendCon](http://www.zendcon.com/) this year; in talking
with [Christian Wenz](http://twitter.com/chwenz), we're pretty sure that the
two of us and [Andi](http://andigutmans.blogspot.com) are the only ones who
have spoken at all eight events.

Unusually for me, I did not speak on a Zend Framework topic, and had only one
regular slot (I also co-presented a Design Patterns tutorial with my team).
That slot, however, became one of my favorite talks I've delivered: "Designing
Beautiful Software". I've given this talk a couple times before, but I
completely rewrote it for this conference in order to better convey my core
message: beautiful software is maintainable and extensible; writing software is
a craft.

I discovered today that not only was it recorded, but it's been
[posted on YouTube](http://youtu.be/mQsQ6QZ4dGg):

<!--- EXTENDED -->

I've also [posted the slides](//slides.mwop.net/2012-10-25-BeautifulSoftware/BeautifulSoftware.html).
