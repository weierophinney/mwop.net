[Cal Evans](http://blog.calevans.com) has organized another DayCamp4Developers
event, this time entitled ["PHP Master Series, Volume 1"](http://blog.calevans.com/2012/11/19/php-master-series-vol-1).
I'm honored to be an invited speaker for this first edition, where I'll be
presenting my talk, "Designing Beautiful Software".

Why would you want to participate? Well, for one, because you can interact
directly with the various speakers during the presentations. Sure, you can
likely find the slide decks elsewhere, or possibly even recordings. But if we
all do our jobs right, we'll likely raise more questions than answers; if you
attend, you'll get a chance to ask some of your questions immediately, *and we
may even answer them!*

On top of that, this is a fantastic lineup of speakers, and, frankly, not a
lineup I've ever participated in. In a typical conference, you'd likely see one
or two of us, and be lucky if we weren't scheduled against each other; if you
attend this week, you'll get to see us all, back-to-back.

What else will you be doing this Friday, anyways, while
[you wait for the end of the world?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon)

So, do yourself a favor, and [register today](http://phpmasterseriesv1.eventbrite.com/)!
