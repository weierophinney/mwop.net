As a continuing part of my MVC series, I've posted a new article on
[Form Decorators](http://devzone.zend.com/article/3450-Decorators-with-Zend_Form)
up on the DevZone.

I'm hoping this will be the definitive guide to using form decorators. I cover
the design decisions behind them, basics of operation, how to customize output
by mixing and matching standard decorators, and how to create your own custom
decorators. Among the examples are how to create a table-based layout for your
forms (instead of the dynamic list layout used by default), and how to use a
View Script as your form decorator in order to have full control over your form
layout.

So, if you've been playing with `Zend_Form` and having trouble wrapping your
head around decorators, [give it a read](http://devzone.zend.com/article/3450-Decorators-with-Zend_Form)!
