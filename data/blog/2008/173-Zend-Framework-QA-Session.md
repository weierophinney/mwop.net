With 1.0 and 1.5 of [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) now released,
there are a lot of questions flying around -- what will we do next, what
components to expect, what are some of the best practices, etc. So, we're going
to have an open [Question and Answer Session](http://devzone.zend.com/article/3448-Zend-Framework)
webinar, with all of us on the internal team.

If you have a question you want answered, please be kind enough to
[submit your question in advance](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43922),
so we have time to actually think about it (though you can always broadside us
during the webinar).

[Sign up](http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/event/webinar-zend-framework-the-big-q-a) in advance so you don't miss out!
