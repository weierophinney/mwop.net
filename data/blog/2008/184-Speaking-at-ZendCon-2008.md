I'll be speaking at [ZendCon](http://www.zendcon.com/) again this year, and have a four-course meal of sessions to deliver:

- **Best Practices of PHP Development**: [Mike
  Naberezny](http://mikenaberezny.com/) and I are teaming up for the fourth
  year running to deliver a tutorial session. While the session topic stays the
  same, he and I have each been developing a number of new practices over the
  past year that we look forward to presenting, including new work with PHPUnit
  for functional testing of your applications.

- **Getting Started with Zend Framework**: This will build off our [Quick Start](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart),
  providing background on ZF as well as the basic tools and information needed
  to get your first ZF application up and running. I also hope to demonstrate
  how the current preview of `Zend_Tool` can simplify this dramatically.

- **Zend_Layout and Zend_Form**: This session will show off features of
  `Zend_Layout` and `Zend_Form`. (Note: the subject matter may change.)

- **UnCon: Rich UIs and Easy XHR with Dojo and Zend Framework**: For those
  unable to attend my webinar next week, or who simply want to see this in
  person, I'll be presenting my Dojo and Zend Framework talk during an UnCon
  session. I have developed a simple app to showcase various features of the
  Dojo/ZF integration, and to show how easy it is to quickly develop and then
  scale applications that have great, dynamic interfaces.

Looking forward to seeing you in California in September!
