I'm giving a [webinar on Zend Framework and Dojo Integration](http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/event/webinar-zend-framework-and-dojo-integration) this coming Wednesday, 3 Sept 2008.

I'm particularly excited about this webinar, as I've been developing a sample pastebin application to show off a number of features; the webinar will feature some screencasts showing the new code in action, and promises to be much more dynamic than my typical "bullet point and code" presentations.

I'm also going to show some techniques to use when developing with ZF+Dojo, including how to create custom builds once you're ready to deploy your application (and why you want to do so).
