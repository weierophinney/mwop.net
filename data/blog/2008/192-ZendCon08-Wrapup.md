I'm a bit late on my [ZendCon'08](http://www.zendcon.com/) wrapup; the
conference left me both exhausted and with a backlog of email and work that has
consumed me since it ended. However, this, too, is good, as it has given me
time to reflect… and to finally get my slides up on SlideShare.

ZendCon was alternately exhausting, rewarding, educational, fruitful,
infurating, and ultimately wonderful. I've been to every single ZendCon so far
— I started at Zend a scant month before the inaugural event — and have spoken
at each. My first time speaking was a fluke; [David Sklar](http://www.sklar.com/)
had just started at [Ning](http://www.ning.com/) and had to back out of his
"Configuring PHP" tutorial session. [Mike Naberezny](http://mikenaberezny.com/)
and I were drafted to take it over, and we had N+1 attendees, where N was the
number of speakers. Since that inauspicious beginning, I've gradually taken on
more sessions and stuck around to participate in the conference more. I can
honestly say that this was the biggest, busiest, and most community focussed
ZendCon I can remember.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

This year, I was involved in a marathon seven — yes, that's right, seven —
sessions over three days, and only finally got the last day off.
[Mike](http://mikenaberezny.com/) and I did our
[Best Practices tutorial session](http://www.slideshare.net/weierophinney/best-practices-of-php-development-presentation/)
on Monday, which was very well attended. Based on the numbers of people raising
their hands as we asked if they were implementing or familiar with the various
practices we enumerated, we may be able to begin doing more advanced, in-depth
sessions in the future.

On Tuesday, [Stefan Priebsch](http://inside.e-novative.de/) ~~roped me into~~
convinced me to help with a "round table" UnConference session on the role of
ORMs in PHP. The consensus we had was that ORM tools are quite good for
prototyping and rapid development, but that any good ORM solution should
de-couple the data access layer to allow stubbing with well-tuned SQL when
performance becomes a consideration.

Later that morning, I did a presentation on [Getting Started with Zend Framework](http://www.slideshare.net/weierophinney/getting-started-with-zend-framework-presentation/).
I developed this presentation to follow our newly re-launched
[Quick Start](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart). The talk was very well
attended, and I received some excellent questions from attendees following the
talk. I hope to streamline it in the future so it can be presented as a
screencast or webinar. If you are interested in the material, I suggest heading
to the link above and downloading the quick start materials; they are
well-documented and will cover at least as much as I covered in the talk.

In the afternoon, I did another unconference session, this time performing my
[Rich UIs and Easy XHR with Dojo and Zend Framework](http://www.slideshare.net/weierophinney/rich-uis-and-easy-remoting-with-dojo-and-zend-framework-presentation/)
talk. (Did I mention that conference attendees could not seem to get enough
Zend Framework material?) I really enjoyed doing this talk *live* this time
(I've done it previously for a webinar) — I received some wonderful questions,
but even better, I was able to gauge the audience reactions to what I was
presenting. I was pleased to see people getting as excited about Dojo as I've
become, and I hope to see that enthusiasm grow. Dojo is truly a fantastic
choice when it comes to javascript toolkits, and I think I suitably
demonstrated how easy it is to use Dojo now from Zend Framework.

Tuesday afternoon, I presented my session on
[Zend_Form](http://www.slideshare.net/weierophinney/zendform-presentation/).
We'd originally planned to do a talk on `Zend_Layout` and `Zend_Form`, but
there's at least two hours of material there that simply does not condense to 1
hour. Instead, we had Ralph present a session on `Zend_Layout` during an
UnConference session, while I focussed on `Zend_Form`. Again, it was fun to do
this in front of a live audience — albeit one I could barely see from my perch
on the mainstage. I saw some places to trim for next time — which will allow me
to show off `Zend_Dojo` integration with `Zend_Form` in the future.

Immediately following that, I headed off to do yet another UnConference session
with [Lorna Jane](http://lornajane.net/). [Keith Casey](http://caseysoftware.com/blog)
had approached me on Monday following the tutorial Mike and I presented,
indicating that there were requests for an "svn tips and tricks" presentation
for the UnCon. I told him to ask Lorna Jane if she'd be interested, as I'd seen
her do an excellent presentation on the subject at the Dutch PHP Conference in
June. After some back and forth, we decided to do it together, and sketched out
a rough outline early Wednesday morning. The talk was very well attended, and
again had great audience participation. Doing the presentation has inspired us
to consider submitting a joint proposal for a conference in the future.

I quickly ran downstairs, only to find I was immediately wanted for a "Meet the
Team" session. This has become a staple at ZendCon, and has had led to some…
interesting… interchanges in the past. This year, the session was packed, and
we had some very good discussions touching on every Zend product — from Zend
Framework to Zend Platform. There were certainly some hecklers, but all of it
was in good fun, and we had a brilliant time. (Man, I think hanging with the UK
folk has worn off on my vocabulary.)

I actually attended fewer sessions than I was involved in, which was unusual
and strange. Every one I was able to attend was quite good. Standouts for me
include Jay Pipes' tutorial on Join Foo, which raised many questions for me and
sparked a number of discussion points all week. Additionally, I was delighted
to be able to attend Alex Russell's Dojo talk; I've exchanged dozens of emails
with him over the past months while doing the ZF/Dojo integration, and it was
fascinating to hear his summary of the state of HTML and browser support, as
well as how he feels Dojo fits in the ecosystem. I was fortunate enough to be
able to grab him afterwards so we could have lunch and talk shop — and got an
even larger surprise to discover he was not only familiar with all aspects of
the Dojo support I'd done, but had used much of it!

Being as busy as I was, I didn't have much chance to stop and enjoy the
community until Wednesday evening. And the community is quite vibrant! I have
often been behind in my slide preparations or tied up in meetings and unable to
"join the fun" that often marks good PHP events. This time, I felt quite tapped
into the community, as well as welcomed by all. I had innumerable
conversations, both with people wholly unfamiliar to me, people I've seen
yearly at ZendCon, and people I've been "seeing" virtually on IRC and the
mailing lists. The strength of any open source project is only as good as the
community it attracts, and on this basis alone, PHP is thriving.

So, goodbye, ZendCon08 and all my new and old friends — let's hope we can meet
again next year!
