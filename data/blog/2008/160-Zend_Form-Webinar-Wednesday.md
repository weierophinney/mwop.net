Just an FYI for anyone interested: I'll be performing a webinar for this week's
Zend Wednesday Webinar series on
[Zend_Form](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.html). You can get
details on the webinar and how to register for it at
[the Zend_Form webinar information page](http://www.zend.com/en/company/news/event/webinar-zend-framework-forms).

I'll be covering the design of `Zend_Form`, the basic usage and various classes
and plugins available, and internationalization of your forms. Please join me
Wednesday at noon EST!
