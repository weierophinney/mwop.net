So, one thing I forgot to mention in my [DPC08 wrapup](/blog/179-DPC08-Wrapup.html)
was my involvement with the [phpwomen booth](http://www.phpwomen.org/).
[Lig](http://www.khankennels.com/blog/) emailed me some months in advance
asking if I'd be an official "booth babe" while at the conference — basically
wearing a T-shirt to show my support of the movement, and answering any
questions that others might have regarding it. While I haven't been
particularly active with phpwomen, I of course agreed.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

As [Lorna Jane](http://www.lornajane.net/) noted, there were *very* few women
at the conference. I'd say estimating them at 2% of total attendees would very
much be a stretch. Also very strange was how little interest the phpwomen booth
attracted — during those times I was at the booth, we'd get a few people
coming forward, but not many… and very few males. This is very much in
contrast to my observations at ZendCon last year, when there were almost
constantly folks at the booth, and dozens of males were wearing the phpwomen
t-shirts throughout the conference.

That said, one very funny picture came out of my participation, snapped by [Stefan](http://www.leftontheweb.com/):

I think it speaks for itself, no? :-)
