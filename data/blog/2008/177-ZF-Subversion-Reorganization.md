If you've found that your SVN checkouts or `svn:externals` of [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) are not working currently, then you missed the announcements on `fw-general` and `#zftalk`; I've just completed a [Subversion Reorganization](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFUSER/Subversion+Migration+Information) that is part of our new proposal process and 'Extras' offering. Please follow the link for details on how to update your installs.
