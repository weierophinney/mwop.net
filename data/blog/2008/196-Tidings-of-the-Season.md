Just about every day, I have an idea for a blog post, and most days, by the end
of the day, I just don't have the time or energy to actually write anything up.
The inner writer in me screams, "no excuses!" while the aging adult in me
whispers, "time for bed, dear."

So, to keep my hand in the game, here are a few things running through my head,
or that I'm working on, or that I'll be doing soon.

### Speaking at PHP Quebec

![PHP Quebec 2009](http://conf.phpquebec.org/img/icone/2009/2009_150x100_speakat_blue_en.gif)

I'm speaking at PHP Quebec this coming spring, and presenting "Practical Zend
Framework Jutsu with Dojo". I will be reworking the talk I did at php|works to
present new features and new techniques I've been working on for effectively
using Dojo and Zend Framework together. Hopefully my laptop and the projector
will play nice together this time!

### PHP Advent Calendar

[Chris Shiflett](http://shiflett.org/) and [Sean Coates](http://seancoates.com)
have generously donated some time and a domain to this year's
[PHP Advent Calendar](http://phpadvent.org/2008). I was invited to submit an
entry, and wrote up a piece I titled ["Use Responsibly"](http://phpadvent.org/2008/use-responsibly-by-matthew-weier-ophinney),
where I discuss good development habits when consuming open source projects.

### Burlington, VT PHP User's Group

This week marks the one year anniversary of regular meetings of the
[Burlington, VT PHP User's Group](http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP).
We [meet this week](http://groups.google.com/group/Burlington-VT-PHP/web/meeting-2008-12-04)
for a special presentation from [Josh Sled](http://asynchronous.org/) of Sun
Microsystems, on database indexing, joins and subqueries, database
optimization, and more. If you're in the area Thursday evening, come join us!

### Zend Framework 1.7.1

Yesterday, we released [Zend Framework 1.7.1](http://framework.zend.com/download/latest),
the first bugfix release in the 1.7 series. Not much more to say about it,
other than start downloading!

### Pastebin updates

I've been continuing development on the [pastebin application](http://github.com/weierophinney/pastebin)
I developed for demonstrating Zend Framework and Dojo integration. In the past
couple weeks, I've reworked it substantially, adding support for `dojo.back` so
as to stay in the same page while utilizing the application; the results are
quite good. One side effect of this is that I've reworked and simplified the
view scripts, and added REST, JSON-RPC, and XML-RPC endpoints to simplify the
XHR infrastructure.  I'm getting pretty happy with the results…

…which has led me to jump to the next milestone, which is to integrate the
[bug application](http://github.com/weierophinney/bugapp) I worked up for the Dutch
PHP Conference last summer and start creating a suite of collaborative
developer tools. These are intended to do three things: (1) demonstrate best
practices and good architecture when using Zend Framework, (2) demonstrate
appropriate techniques when using Dojo with Zend Framework, and (3) to scratch
an itch (I'd like to use these tools for my personal projects). I've code named
the project "Spindle", a name I like for its rich connotations. If you're
interested in contributing, drop me a line, and I'll set you up with commit
access. Or fork it, and send me patches. Whatever.

### Oh, and one more thing…

Ha! fooled you!

Seriously, though, there are, to quote something I saw on
[twitter](http://twitter.com) today, a "metric shit-ton" of holidays and
observances of just about every faith and geographic origin in the coming
month. Enjoy, and best tidings of the season to you!
