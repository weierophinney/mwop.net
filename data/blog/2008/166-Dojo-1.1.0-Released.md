[Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) announced today the availability of 1.1.0.

I've been toying with Dojo off-and-on for almost a year now. It's the most
framework-y of the various JS toolkits I've tried, and I particularly
appreciate its modularity. (That said, it can lead to a lot of HTTP requests to
your site if you don't create a targetted bundle with the modules you need.)

The 1.1.0 release has me pretty excited, as it finally is doing something most
other JS frameworks have been doing for some time: its XHR requests now send
the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header, which allows it to conform to
the `isXmlHttpRequest()` method in Zend Framework's request object. This makes
it much easier to provide a standard mechanism in your server-side code for
detecting AJAX requests, allowing context switching to be automated.
