I'm pleased to announce I've been selected to speak at [php|works](http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/index) in Atlanta this November.

I'll be presenting my [talk on Dojo and Zend Framework](http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/d1s5/1), demonstrating how to quickly and easily create rich and dynamic UIs using the various integration points with Dojo functionality provided by Zend Framework.

Looking forward to seeing you in Atlanta in November!
