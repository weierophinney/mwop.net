Last Friday and Saturday I spent at [the Dutch PHP Conference](http://phpconference.nl/), hosted by
[Ibuildings](http://ibuildings.nl/). Unfortunately, I had very little time to
blog while there. I'd prepared my outlines and basic slides before heading to
the conference, but had a large number of screenshots and images to prepare
that kept me up until the wee hours of the morning each day. In addition, the
conference was extremely well organized — which meant that any time not spent
speaking was spent interacting with attendees or other speakers — never a bad
thing!

<!--- EXTENDED -->

First off, the big impression I had when the conference finished is that either
PHP developers in Holland are incredibly professional, or that the best
practices advocated by various community leaders are finally taking hold. My
last talk was one addressing development best practices, and I was constantly
amazed at how many people were *already* using most if not all the best
practices I touched on in my talk. This is really fantastic news, as far as I'm
concerned; hopefully all those PHP detractors out there are going to start
taking notice that PHP development has matured, and, in fact become very
quality oriented. Here's that presentation:

The big event for me, of course, was the full day Zend Framework workshop. My
two regrets: a) not having a better script for the final hour, when I covered a
simple demo bugapp used for developing the workshop, and b) running opposite
[Sebastian Bergmann](http://sebastian-bergmann.de) — as I wanted to see what
he's been working on recently with [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/). That said, I
feel the workshop went over very well; I was able to finish each section early
enough that we had time for 5 - 15 minutes of questions over the material just
covered, and there were excellent questions from those attending. The funny
part was that with two of the questions, I simply fired up my browser to the
tutorials I wrote on [DevZone](http://devzone.zend.com/), and used the examples
and materials from them to answer the questions.

As promised, I've [uploaded the bug application](/uploads/bugapp.tar.gz) I
worked up to create the session. Be aware that it's incomplete; the main thing
was to see how each of the various pieces could interact so I'd know what to
cover and when in the workshop.

Following the night of the workshops, Ibuildings had a dinner for their
employees, and I was invited to tag along. I had some great conversations with
[Lorna Jane](http://www.lornajane.net) and one of her colleagues, Bill,
discussing topics ranging from family to training, from travel to PHP, and
more. Dinner was timed to end as the big match between Holland and France
began, and all I have to say about that is: if you've never witnessed the fans
of a big football match in Holland when Oranje is winning, you haven't lived.
'Nuff said. :-)

I had a number of good conversations with a variety of people, really —
[Stefan Priebsch](http://inside.e-novative.de/),
[Sebastian](http://sebastian-bergmann.de/), [Zeev](http://suraski.net/blog/),
[Marco Tabini](http://mtabini.blogspot.com), Lorna Jane, Stefan Koopfmanschap,
[Fabien Potencier](http://www.aide-de-camp.org/), and more. (Believe it or not,
you *can* get more than one framework lead in the same room and have things
stay civil; Fabien and I swapped some information regarding plans for our next
major releases, what issues we've seen, and what features we're excited about.)
[Felix De Vliegher](http://felix.phpbelgium.be/blog/) and
[Michelangelo Van Dam](http://www.dragonbe.com/) were also there, representing
PHP Belgium, and it was great to hear how their region's PHP community is
starting to come together.

I also got a chance to meet a few people from the Zend Framework lists and IRC
in person: Andries Seutens, Jurrien Stutterheim, and Bart McLeod — and a few
others whose names I most regrettably forget. I wish I could have had more time
to talk with each of you, and discuss your projects more.

Now, while the conference was fantastic, probably the best part for me
personally was the day prior. My good friend [Remi](http://www.wolerized.com/),
with whom I've worked on some projects at Zend a number of times over the past
year, came up from Gouda to hang with me for the day. We walked all over the
city — through the Vondelpark, up by the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museums,
along and over countless canals, near (but not through) the red light district,
by the RAI (where the conference was held) and all the way up to Grand
Centraal. I complained about sore feet and legs all weekend, but it was the
best tour I could have imagined of the city, and one I shan't forget any time
soon. And the reason we went to Grand Centraal was to meet up with
[Stefan Koopmanschap](http://www.leftontheweb.com/), with whom we would then have
dinner and drinks that night. I feel very fortunate to have had the chance to
spend some uninterrupted time with each of these fantastic developers and
individuals.

So, the short summary: excellent conference, excellent friends, excellent city.
Looking forward to DPC '09!
