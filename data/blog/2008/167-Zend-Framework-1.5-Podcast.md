Cal has released a new [PHP Abstract](http://devzone.zend.com/tag/PHP_Abstract)
podcast today on the [Zend Developer Zone](http://devzone.zend.com/), an
interview with Wil Sinclair, the project manager for
[Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/), and Brad Cottel, Zend's product
Evangelist. In it, they talk quite a bit about the work I've done on Zend Form,
and also a lot about the proposal process.

If you're interested in the new 1.5 features, or how the proposal process works
and who contributes to the community, [give it a listen!](http://devzone.zend.com/article/3348-PHP-Abstract-Podcast-Episode-37-Zend-Framework-1.5)
