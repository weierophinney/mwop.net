I've been getting a lot of interest in my
[Pastebin](/blog/189-Pastebin-app-and-conference-updates.html) demo app â€”
partly by those wanting to play with Dojo+ZF, partly by those just interested
in the application.

I'm constantly trying to improve the application. I've done one webinar and one
UnCon session showcasing it, and will be presenting it at
[Dojo Develper Day in Boston](http://dojotoolkit.org/2008/07/10/dojo-developer-day-boston)
this Monday as well as at [php|works](http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/index) later
this fall, and want to keep the materials up-to-date and freely available. To
this end, I've created a [Github](http://github.com) repository so you can
track the latest developments, as well as pull custom tarballs:

All patches and feedback are welcome!
