I've known for some time, but was reluctant to blog about it until the plane
tickets were purchased and in hand: I've been invited to speak at the
[Dutch PHP Conference](http://phpconference.nl/) this coming June:

![DPC](http://phpconference.nl/img/dpc08/logoDPC08_small.png)

I'll be presenting two separate sessions: [an all day tutorial](http://phpconference.nl/workshops/) on 13 June 2008 covering Zend Framework, and a regular session on 14 June 2008 covering [Best Practices for PHP development](http://phpconference.nl/schedule/bestpractices), which will focus on how to utilize Zend Framework coding standards and methodologies to help deliver efficient, high quality code for your organization.

I'm looking forward to meeting old and new friends alike at the conference!
