I've been using IRC regularly for the past six to nine months, in large part
due to the growing ZF community on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/)
`#zftalk` channel (unfortunately, I simply don't have time to be in that
particular channel any more, but you can generally find me in `#zftalk.dev`),
but also to keep in contact with other peers, friends, and colleagues.

One difficulty, however, is keeping productivity high while staying on IRC. To
me, the ultimate client would provide me notifications when somebody mentions
my name or a watch word — allowing me to read the channel at my leisure, yet
still respond to people in a timely fashion.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

I've tried a variety of IRC clients over the months, starting with Pidgin (poor
interface for IRC), mirc (huge difficulties figuring out the UI), xchat (not
bad, but seemed a bit heavy), Chatzilla (I liked the interface, but once you
got many tabs going, it was unwieldy switching around between them; I also
hated that Firefox dying or restarting caused Chatzilla to do likewise), and
now [irssi](http://irssi.org/).

So far, irssi is the best I've tried — I can run it in screen, allowing me to
keep it open as long as my machine is running. The interface is reasonable, and
cleanly keeps channels separate from private messages. Opening, closing, and
manipulating windows is easy. And it's highly scriptable… including in a
language I actually use! The perl bindings are top notch, though sometimes
cryptic. What's important, however, is that there are plenty of examples out
there if you want to try doing something. So, I figured I'd write up a quick
plugin to trigger notifications.

I've been using a number of different notification servers for linux, and
personally like both [gnotify](http://gnotify.sourceforge.net) and
[mumbles](http://www.mumbles-project.org/). Both are very lightweight and offer
network protocols for triggering notifications.

I first tried using gnotify. It has a very, very simple TCP protocol, and I've
had success creating messages from the shell, PHP, and perl. Unfortunately, for
some reason, using it in irssi displayed some odd behavior: I'd lose the cursor
and the ability to enter input from the time a notification triggered until it
completed (i.e., the notification disappeared). Forking the process did not
appear to help.

So, I decided to try out mumbles. Mumbles is written in python, and has
themeable notifications — already a plus. It runs via dbus by default, but can
also optionally spawn a server that implements the [Growl protocol](http://growl.info/)
— making it accessible for any process to send notifications. Additionally, it
has a command-line utility for triggering notifications — by default over dbus,
but optionally by contacting the growl server, if running.

Growl's protocol is a bit involved, and I didn't want to spend too much time on
this. So, I did a quick, dirty hack: I used backticks to trigger the CLI
utility. And it works *fantastically* — no delays whatsoever. Here's the code:

```perl
# $HOME/.irssi/scripts/mumbles.pl
use strict;
use Irssi;
use Irssi::Irc;
use vars qw($VERSION %IRSSI);

$VERSION = '0.1.0';
%IRSSI = (
    authors     => "Matthew Weier O'Phinney",
    contact     => 'matthew@weierophinney.net',
    name        => 'Mumbles notifications for irssi',
    description => 'This script enables mumbles notifications for irssi',
    license     => 'New BSD',
    changed     => "2008-12-10"
);


sub mumbles_sig_printtext {
  my ($dest, $text, $stripped) = @_;

  if (($dest->{level} & (MSGLEVEL_HILIGHT|MSGLEVEL_MSGS)) && ($dest->{level} & MSGLEVEL_NOHILIGHT) == 0)
  {
    if ($dest->{level} & MSGLEVEL_PUBLIC)
    {
      mumbles($dest->{target} . " : " . $text);
    }
  }
}

sub mumbles {
    my $message = shift;
    my $response;

    $message =~ s/[^!-~\s]//g;

    `/usr/bin/mumbles-send -g 127.0.0.1 -s "IRC" "$message"`;
}

Irssi::command_bind 'mumbles' => sub {
    my ($message) = @_;
    mumbles($message);
};

Irssi::signal_add({
  'print text'    => \&mumbles_sig_printtext
});
```

This triggers a notification for any "highlight" event — basically, anytime
anybody "says" my name in a channel, or mentions a keyword I've marked for
highlighting. Additionally, I created a `mumbles` command so that I can send
test messages (usage: `/mumbles "this is the message..."`). You could certainly
bind to other events, such as topic changes, joins, parts, etc — I'm only
interested in highlight events.

You may note the regexp in there. One thing I discovered was that most messages
contained control and non-ascii characters that often resulted in unreadable
notifications, as well as some nasty messages reported by irssi. The regexp
removes anything not in the ascii character set or the set of whitespace
definitions prior to emitting the notification.

Something else I needed to do was configure compiz to ensure that the
notifications actually popped *above* my windows. I did this by going into the
compiz configuration manager, selecting "General Options", selecting the "Focus
& Raise Behaviour" tab, and modifying the "Focus Prevention Windows" to read as
follows:

```
(any) & !(class=Mumbles)
```

To test it, I placed the script in `$HOME/.irssi/scripts/mumbles.pl`, and then,
in irssi, executed `/load mumbles.pl`.

Once I had it to my liking, I symlinked it into my
`$HOME/.irssi/scripts/autorun/` directory, allowing it to run as soon as irssi
loads. I can now have irssi running in a screen session, or minimize the
terminal, and get notifications — keeping me productive and informed at the
same time.

**UPDATED 2008-12-12:** Added information on how to load the script, as well as
fixed the location to the autorun directory. Thanks, @sidhighwind!
