I'm doing a series of articles on various [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)
MVC topics for the [Zend Developer Zone](http://devzone.zend.com/). Last week,
I covered Action Helpers. This week, I cover [Front Controller Plugins](http://devzone.zend.com/article/3372-Front-Controller-Plugins-in-Zend-Framework).
If you've ever been mystified by or curious about this subject, head on over
and give it a read!
