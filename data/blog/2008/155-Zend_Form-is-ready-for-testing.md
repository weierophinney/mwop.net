I've spent the last couple months gathering requirements for the `Zend_Form`
component, building a prototype, creating a composite proposal based on existing
proposals and my research, gathering community feedback, and, finally coding the
implementation. It's a testament to the value of Test Driven Development that I
now have 302 unit tests passing covering the codebaseâ€¦ all in just over a
week's time.

So, if you're interested in `Zend_Form`, now is the time to start testing it. You
can grab it from subversion, where you'll find it in the incubator. You can find
[preliminary documentation](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend_Form+Notes) on
the Framework wiki.
