I announced this earlier in the year, but for those that missed it, I'm speaking
at [php|tek](http://tek.mtacon.com/) next week.

![Speaking at php|tek 2009](/uploads/tek_09_badge_speaker.gif)

I'll be co-presenting a workshop entitled
[Practical SVN for PHP Developers](http://tek.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/ts2/0)
along with the lovely and talented [Lorna Jane Mitchell](http://www.lornajane.net/).
In a way, it's a continuation of the unconference session we did together at
ZendCon08, and will provide much more in-depth information on the subject —
including how to create and organize your repositories, branching and tagging
strategies, how and when to commit, as well as more basic usage of subversion
for day-to-day use.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

I've also proposed two unconference sessions:

- [Using Git to take SVN offline](http://joind.in/talk/view/437) continues the
  version control theme. In it, I plan to demonstrate and discuss git+svn, a set
  of tools I use daily to allow me the benefits of a distributed versioning
  system backed by a non-distributed, canonical system.
- [Play-dough: How to Model Your PHP Objects](http://joind.in/talk/view/436) is
  a continuation of a series of blog posts I did earlier this year on creating
  models for your MVC systems. I plan to look at some common design patterns,
  including Service Layers, Domain Models, Data Mappers, Transaction Scripts,
  ActiveRecord, and Table and Row Data Gateways — and where and when each may
  make sense in your application.

If you're interested in either of the above two topics, follow the links and
vote. Or, if you just want to see me run around like a chicken with its head cut
off for two days as I scramble to put materials together, that works as well.

If you're going to php|tek next week, please look me up. And if you're not, it's
not too late [to register](http://tek.mtacon.com/c/signup)!
