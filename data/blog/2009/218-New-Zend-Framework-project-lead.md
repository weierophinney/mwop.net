We've recently reorganized the Zend Framework team. Below is an announcement
just sent to our fw-general mailing list.

> Greetings!
>
> The Zend Framework team has undergone some internal reorganization
> recently which will have some bearing on the project.
>
> First, the team now reports to Zeev Suraski, Zend's CTO. Please welcome
> him to the lists!
>
> Additionally, Wil Sinclair is ending his tenure as the Zend Framework
> team leader. During his time as project lead, Zend Framework has made
> tremendous progress in becoming the de-facto standard for PHP
> development, with several significant achievements:
>
>   * The 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 releases, as well as the recent 1.8 preview
>     release
>   * Helped support and build partnerships with the Dojo Foundation,
>     Adobe, and others
>   * Introduction of agile methodologies to the ZF team
>   * Usage of social networking media as an additional support vector
>
> I'd like to thank Wil for his contributions to the Zend Framework
> project!
>
> I am pleased to announce my own promotion to the position of Project
> Lead. I have worked with Andi and Zeev in recent weeks to define how I
> will approach this role, and have emphasized during that time the need
> to address and respond to community concerns and needs. 
>
> Following the 1.8 release, the team will be focussing on items such as
> whiddling down the bug backlog, improving documentation, and writing
> tutorials. Additionally, we will be outlining and scoping upcoming
> releases in order to publish a public roadmap for the project. Part of
> this effort will include some work to make the proposal process easier
> and more transparent. The hope is that having published milestones will
> help focus user contributions, both in terms of new features and
> stabilizing the framework.
>
> I look forward to working with each and every one of you, and welcome
> your feedback!

When I began at Zend three and a half years ago, I certainly never expected that
I'd be leading the Zend Framework project. It has been a long, strange journey
getting here, and I'm excited to be taking the reins on the project, and look
forward to implementing some new tools and processes to better facilitate
community involvement. I'd like to thank the Zend Framework community at large
for the huge amount of support and feedback you've given me in the past few
years.

Let's marshall on and get the 1.8 release done, and step forward into the
future!
