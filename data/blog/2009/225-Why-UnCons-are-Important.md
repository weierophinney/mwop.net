My good friend, [Keith Casey](http://caseysoftware.com/blog/), is once again
chairing [Zendcon's](http://zendcon.com/) [UnCon](http://joind.in/event/zendcon09-uncon).
For those who have never attended, it's basically one or more tracks running
parallel to the main conference, but with content pitched by attendees —
sometimes presented by them, other times presented by others who are
knowledgeable in the field.

Why should you care? There are great sessions already selected for the
conference featuring some well-known speakers from the PHP world; why would you
want to either attend or present at the uncon?

<!--- EXTENDED -->

Continue the Discussion
-----------------------

Last year, I did a tutorial session with [Mike Naberezny](http://mikenaberezny.com)
covering PHP development best practices.  Following the session, several
attendees approached Keith and said they could really use a session just on
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/); the material covered in the
tutorial, while good, did not go into enough depth for them.

Keith then approached me about doing an uncon session, and I in turn tagged
[Lorna Jane Mitchell](http://www.lornajane.net) about doing the session. We
ended up doing it together, after sitting down for about 10 minutes of planning.
We had the flexibility to both go over what we thought were core basics everyone
should know, as well as to answer very specific questions. The session was very
well attended, and those people who gave us feedback indicated that it was
exactly the amount of detail they were looking for.

So, in summary, the uncon allowed attendees to get more information on a topic
that was covered only briefly in another, regular session.

Springboard to Speaking
-----------------------

Was your talk rejected for the conference? Are you having trouble getting
accepted to any conferences at all?

Conference organizers have a catch-22 they face every time they put together a
schedule. On the one hand, there may be some really interesting talks submitted
by unknown speakers; on the other, scheduling known speakers helps put money on
the table (attendees want to hear from established experts). As a result, you
see a lot of the same speakers at each and every conference.

So, how do *you* break in? You speak.

Speaking at area user groups is one way to break into the system; good sessions
often generate buzz that extends beyond your user group. But an even better way
is to speak at an uncon session at an established conference. Oftentimes you'll
have conference organizers attending these, or friends of conference organizers,
and this can have a huge impact on your chances at speaking. Additionally, I've
seen a ton of buzz generated on twitter and blogs by uncon sessions — and this
buzz gets noticed.

Don't believe me? Let's revisit that talk Lorna Jane and I gave. We pitched it
as a tutorial session for [php|tek](http://tek.mtacon.com/) this spring… and it
was accepted, largely on the basis of our uncon session. It was the only talk I
pitched for that conference that was accepted. (Believe it or not, I have to
submit talks just like everyone else, and get a fair share of rejections just
like everyone else.)

At php|tek, I also pitched two uncon tracks, one on using Git with SVN, and
another on how to write domain models for your MVC layers. This latter session,
on models, generated a lot of buzz, and was later picked up by MTA for a
[CodeWorks 2009](http://codeworks.mtacon.com/) webinar, which was very well
received. I also pitched it for ZendCon this year… and will be presenting it
there in two weeks.

In short, if you want to speak at conferences, start by pitching ideas to the
uncon tracks at conferences you attend. Prepare well for it, make a good
impression, and you may be delivering it as a regular session at another
conference.

Explore new ideas
-----------------

Conference organizers, besides having to choose well-known speakers, often also
need to stick to known topics. Part of the reason you see topics on the buzz
words du jour is because people want to see sessions on them. But what about
things like PHP-GTK? or using PHP to write CLI tools? or using PHP to connect to
a specific web service? These may all be interesting, but may not attract
crowds. But what if *you*, as an attendee, want to hear about these topics?

One aspect of the uncon is that you can vote on topics and/or suggest topics you
want to hear about. This gives you a chance to help shape the direction of the
conference to cater to your own interests. It also allows you to explore some
areas of the language you may not have known about, but, when you see the
presentation abstract, could benefit the work you do.

So, use the uncon to explore the language!
