As I write this, [ZendCon](http://www.zendcon.com/) begins in less than a week.
I have the honor and pleasure to be speaking there again, for the sixth year
running.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

I'll be speaking twice:

- *Tuesday, 2 November 2010, 10am:* **"Documents, Documents, Documents"**

  Relational databases and web development go hand-in-hand — yet many web apps
  are decidely unsuited to relational storage. A new crop of databases has risen
  in recent years to solve these problems: document databases. Learn what types of
  problems document databases solve, learn what options exist for you, and
  discover some approaches to common web problems using these new technologies.

- *Wednesday, 3 November 2010, 5:15pm:* **"Introducing Zend Framework 2.0"**
  
  No, I won't be announcing a general access release of ZF2! Let's stop that
  rumor right off. Instead, I'll be discussing some history of Zend Framework,
  what lessons we've learned, and the general thrust of ZF2 development.
  Additionally, I'll cover the current state of development, and how *you* can
  get involved.

I'm also on the closing panel:

- *Thursday, 4 November 2010, 11:45am:* **"The ROI of Community Involvement"**

  Join 5 high-profile members of the PHP community who represent various
  interests from projects to large enterprises as we discuss the problems and
  paybacks of getting involved in the community. Many large companies have
  roadblocks that keep them from participating in the PHP community. Many small
  business don't feel they have the time or people to get involved. In both
  cases, not seeing the potential ROI of getting developers involved in the
  community is holding companies back.

Finally, I'm organizing a **Zend Framework roundtable** to occur as an
[UnCon](http://zendcon.com/uncon/) session, and tentatively scheduling this for
*Wednesday morning, at 11am*.

***If you are a ZF contributor, and in the Bay Area that day, but not attending
ZendCon, please contact me if you want to attend the roundtable and/or ZF2 talk;
I can make that happen.***

Will you be at [ZendCon](http://www.zendcon.com/) next week? If so, look me up — I'd love to meet you!
