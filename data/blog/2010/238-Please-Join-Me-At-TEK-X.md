I'll be speaking this year at [TEK-X](http://tek.phparch.com/), this year's incarnation of the php|tek conference, in Chicago in May.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

I have the distinct privilege of doing another tutorial this year with
[Lorna Jane Mitchell](http://lornajane.net/). Unlike last year, we're not sticking to
just Subversion, but instead [covering a whole spectrum of PHP development practices](http://tek.phparch.com/talks/#TEKXT02),
including coding standards and quality assurance. We're both very excited about
the talk; please join us on tutorial day!

I'm also doing an "upgrade" or "reboot" of my Domain Models talk, which I
debuted last year during the UnCon. This time around, I'm going to focus on
[how usage of NoSQL for the datastore](http://tek.phparch.com/talks/#TEKXS15)
affects and informs your domain models â€” and how it might very well radically
change how you develop your applications.

If you'll be attending TEK-X this year, look me up while there; I'd love to meet you!
