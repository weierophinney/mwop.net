A user noted in a comment to my blog on the 1.6.0 release that I'd included a
`public` keyword in the `s_param()` method declarationâ€¦ which caused
compilation to fail in PHP4. So, quick on the heels of that release, I've
released 1.6.1 to correct this issue. Downloads are available at the
[Cgiapp website](http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/index.php/view/Downloads).
