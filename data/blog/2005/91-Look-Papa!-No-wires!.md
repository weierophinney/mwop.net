This has been one of the toughest 10 days of my life. Our little boy, Liam, has
been, and continues to be, in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at
Fletcher Allen Hospital in Burlington, fighting to come home. I divide my time
between home, work, and the hospital; Jen stays up there at night to make sure
he eats well; Maeve keeps asking when Jen and Liam are going to come home; and
Cuervo just wonders when she's going to be on a regular schedule for walks
again.

If Jen's parents hadn't been here last week to take care of us all, I think I
would have gone insane. We've met several other parents who have been there
many weeks, with many weeks still ahead, and I wonder how they can do it, how
they can keep up hope.

Liam is doing well, actually. The round of antibiotics is done, phototreatment
ended last week, and he has passed the "eat, pee, poop, and act like a baby"
requirement to come home. However, his blood sugar has taken quite some time to
stabilize.

The doctors think that because Liam was born into a cold environment, and
hadn't had a chance to develop blood sugar reserves (because he was born
early), he's simply been catching up. They have wanted the weaning process of
removing him from the glucose drip to be closely monitored and gradual, because
if his blood sugar gets too low, it could affect brain development.

So, for the past week, poor Liam's been having his little feet pricked every
3-4 hours so they can test blood sugar, and if the numbers are high enough
enough times in succession, they titrate the glucose solution. The poor kid's
heels are puffy and striated with little red marks, and even the nurses are
tut-tutting every time they have to do it. Every time his numbers are high
enough to turn down the drip, there's a little cheer from us, and we start
counting the feedings until he can come off it.

Tonight it all paid off — they finally were able to take him off the IV. I was
holding him at the time that they flushed the line and removed it (though he
retains an IV in his arm just in case they should need to re-attach him later).
Liam was wide awake, rooting for a nipple, and happy as could be. My heart
swelled to be able to pick him up and walk him around the NICU, untethered for
the first time since he was born.

I found Jen and Maeve in the breastfeeding room, reading stories. I handed him
to Jen, shut the door, and, for the first time, the four of us got to spend
some time alone, just us. It didn't last forever, but it was a good start.

Please send some positive energy Liam's way over the next day — if the blood
sugar stays up, he'll be able to come home with his loving family so we can
begin our new life with him!
