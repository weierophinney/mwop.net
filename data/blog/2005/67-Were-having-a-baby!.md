I can't believe I haven't announced this to the world yet, but Jen and I are
expecting another baby! The due date is mid-September. And… we decided at the
ultrasound this past week we would go ahead and find out the gender… and….

<!--- EXTENDED -->

It's A BOY!!!!

I'm terribly excited, in case you can't tell. I'd had a dream shortly after we
found out we were pregnant that we were at the doctor's for the ultrasound, and
I'd seen quite clearly a little penis; I've been convinced since then that we
would have a boy. It was amazing to have it confirmed — so many emotions ran
through me — how will I be a father to a boy, how will I teach him to shave,
will I need to learn about sports if he takes to them, IT'S A BOY!!!

We've been going through baby names since then. Before Maeve was born, we'd
planned on calling a boy Aidan; a couple years ago, we though maybe Will would
be a good name (Will is one of the principal characters in Philip Pullman's *His
Dark Materials* trilogy). However, one of my co-workers, has two boys — Will
and Aidan — whom Maeve plays with, so those names are out.

We've narrowed the names down to four, though: Nolan, Liam, Gavin, and Devin.
Leave a comment and let us know what you think!

Oh, did I mention — it's a boy!!!!
