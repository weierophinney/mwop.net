I've made two releases of Cgiapp this week, 1.6.2 and 1.6.3.

1.6.2 was tested in a PHP 4.3.4 environment, and features several bugfixes that
give PHP4 compatibility. 1.6.3 fixes a change in `load_tmpl()` that broke
backwards compatibility.

As usual, Cgiapp is available on [the SourceForge website](http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net./),
as is a complete Changelog and documentation.
