Got the official notification: I passed the
[Zend PHP Certification Exam](http://www.zend.com/store/education/certification/zend-php-certification.php),
and can now report I'm a Zend Certified Engineer (ZCE)!

[![Zend Certified Engineer](/matthew/img/zce_logo.gif)](http://zend.com/zce.php?c=ZEND901102&r=0502029)

Thanks go to my bosses at [NGA](http://assoc.garden.org/) for giving me the
opportunity to attend [php|Tropics](http://www.phparch.com/tropics), to
[Marco Tabini](http://www.phparch.com/) for offering the ZCE exam as part of
the php|Tropics conference fee, and to my wife, Jen, and daughter, Maeve, for
putting up with me while I studiedâ€¦ and being good sports about having to
stay home while I went to Cancun. Hopefully next time I can take you along!
