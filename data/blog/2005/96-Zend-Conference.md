Around the time I was hired by Zend, I was asked, along with
[Mike Naberezny](http://www.6502.org/users/mike/blog/), to fill in for a tutorial
session entitled 'Setting up PHP' for the [upcoming Zend/PHP Conference and
Expo](http://zend.kbconferences.com/). The basic premise of the session is to
give a step-by-step tutorial on how to setup and configure PHP for various
scenarios, such as development, testing, and production.

Mike and I have been working in parallel developing ideas and outlines for the
session, and I'm fairly excited to have the opportunity. However, if you're
attending the conference and, in particular, this session, I'd love to hear any
input you might have â€” any tricks you'd love to learn, configuration settings
you don't understand, use cases you might need. Leave a comment!
