So, I did a little experimentation, and I was able to seamlessly integrate
Serendipity into my existing website via Smarty, some CSS, and changing just a
couple of links!

The result is the website you're currently reading!

This means I can now offer trackbacks, comments, RSS feeds, and all the other
stuff a modern blog should offerâ€¦ and with minimum fuss and with a lot of
standards and security. I wish everything I did was this easy.
