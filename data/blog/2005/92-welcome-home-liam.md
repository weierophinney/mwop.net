Yesterday, after 14 days in the hospital, Liam came home!

He gained a full half-pound while in the NICU, eats like a horse, and is a
sweet little man. We're all happy to have both him and Mommy back home; Maeve
was particularly excited, and performed a little dance at daycare when I told
her the whole family was home waiting for her.

Thank you, everyone, for the support over the past two weeks! And welcome home,
Liam!
