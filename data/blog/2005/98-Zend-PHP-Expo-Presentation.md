Mike and I have just finished our talk on "Setting Up PHP". The number of
attendees was N + 1, where N is the number of speakersâ€¦ which was to be
expected, as we were presenting opposite a session on web services, Shiflett's
PHP Security talk, and a crash course on the ZCE. However, it's undoubtedly the
best presentation missed by attendees. :-)
