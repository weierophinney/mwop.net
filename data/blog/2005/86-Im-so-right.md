Not long ago, as Maeve and I were en route to Jen's work one evening, Maeve was
being very insistent that certain things were a certain way, and was very
adamant even as I used a placating tone with her. I asked her, jokingly, "Why
are you so contrary today?" Her reply?

"Because I'm so smart, and because I'm so right."

I almost wrecked the car as I guffawed. Kids. They're so dang cute. And so
right!
