Life is in transition for me now. Two weeks ago, we got to bring our handsome
baby boy home, and I haven't been sleeping much since (though more than Jen).
On top of the sleep deprivation, however, comes more exciting news: I've been
hired as a PHP Developer by [Zend Technologies](http://www.zend.com/)!

I was approached by Daniel Kushner in late July regarding another position at
Zend, and was flown out at the beginning of August. While I felt the interview
went well, I harbored some doubts; work got fairly busy shortly thereafter, and
then, of course, Liam was born, and the interview went completely out of my
head. Until about three days after Liam's birthday, when Daniel contacted me
again about the PHP Developer position.

Work started yesterday, and I was flown to Zend's offices in Cupertino, CA, for
orientation and to sit down with both Daniel and others to prepare for the
projects on which I will be working. Thankfully, the job will not require that
I move, and I will be working out of the 'home office' in Vermont when I return
later this week.

The decision to leave [NGA](http://assoc.garden.org/about) was difficult, but
the opportunity to work with Zend is just too good to miss. I am honored to be
selected by them, and hope this is the beginning of many good things to come.
