What a way to start the day â€” I had an email from PEPR letting me know that my
[File_Fortune proposal](http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=263)
had been accepted!

`File_Fortune` is a PHP OOP interface to reading and writing fortune files. It
is loosely based on the perl module Fortune.pm, but modified significantly to
better work with PHP file access methods, as well as to add writing capability.

I will be uploading my initial release shortly, probably as a beta or RC.

So, go fetch those Simpsons, Hitchhiker's Guide, and Star Wars fortune cookie
databases and prepare to add random quotes to your site!
