    Yesterday, <a href="http://mikenaberezny.com/">Mike</a> and I presented our
    session "Best Practices of PHP Development" at this year's Zend Conference.
    It was a marathon three hour tutorial first thing in the morning, and we had
    an incredible turnout, with some fairly enthusiastic people in the audience.

    We ended up cutting a ton from the session the night before, as we
    discovered we actually had way too much material. Amongst the cuts were
    sections on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Comparisons of different coding standards. I'd worked up a comparison of
        eZ Components and Zend Framework standards to contrast against PEAR's.
    </li>
    <li>
        Functional testing. Mike put a lot of effort into the unit testing
        section, and I'd done an additional section on functional testing --
        testing against fixtures, such as test databases, sandbox services, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repository layout. Mike actually talked about this briefly, but we'd
        intended to show some designs for subversion layouts, and how to create
        and use branches and tags.
    </li>
    <li>
        Subversion hook scripts. We mentioned their existence, and some uses,
        but we'd hoped to show how to add these to your repository, and some
        sample scripts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mailman. How to setup archived mailing lists.
    </li>
    <li>
        Capistrano. Mike mentioned this tool in the talk, but did not have time
        to go into examples of usage.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Basically, most of the topics we covered could have easily been a session in
    their own right. However, having a big block of time to cover the spectrum I
    believe helps show how to integrate the individual solutions into a set of
    cohesive development practices.
</p>
<p>
    I hope to blog about some of the areas we had to skip in coming months.
</p>
<p>
    To those attendees who came to the session yesterday, thank you for being a
    great audience!
