    Mike and I have just finished our talk on "Setting Up PHP". The number of
    attendees was N + 1, where N is the number of speakers... which was to be
    expected, as we were presenting opposite a session on web services,
    Shiflett's PHP Security talk, and a crash course on the ZCE. However, it's
    undoubtedly the best presentation missed by attendees. :-)
