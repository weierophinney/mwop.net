    Not long ago, as Maeve and I were en route to Jen's work one evening, Maeve
    was being very insistent that certain things were a certain way, and was
    very adamant even as I used a placating tone with her. I asked her,
    jokingly, "Why are you so contrary today?" Her reply?
</p>
<p>
    "Because I'm so smart, and because I'm so right."
</p>
<p>
    I almost wrecked the car as I guffawed. Kids. They're so dang cute. And so
    right!
