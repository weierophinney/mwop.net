    So, I did a little experimentation, and I was able to seamlessly integrate
    Serendipity into my existing website via Smarty, some CSS, and changing just
    a couple of links!
</p>
<p>
    The result is the website you're currently reading!
</p>
<p>
    This means I can now offer trackbacks, comments, RSS feeds, and all the
    other stuff a modern blog should offer... and with minimum fuss and with a
    lot of standards and security. I wish everything I did was this easy.
