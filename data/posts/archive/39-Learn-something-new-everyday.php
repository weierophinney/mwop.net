<p>
    <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux.com</a> has had a running series on CLI
    commands for Newbies. Most of it has been very basic, but there are still a
    few gems within. For instance, today I was introduced to <kbd>apropos</kbd>
    and <kbd>whatis</kbd>. Give a search term to the former, and it will list
    all programs in which the search term is found in the manpages; give a
    program name to the latter, and it will tell you which man page addresses
    it.
