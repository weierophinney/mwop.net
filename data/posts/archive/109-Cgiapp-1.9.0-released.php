    I released Cgiapp 1.9.0 into the wild last night. The main difference
    between 1.8.0 and 1.9.0 is that I completely removed the plugin system. I
    hadn't had any users reporting that they were using it, and, in point of
    fact, the overloading mechanism I was using was causing some obscure issues,
    particularly in the behaviour of cgiapp_postrun().

    As usual, you can find more information and links to downloads
    <a href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">at the Cgiapp site.</a>
