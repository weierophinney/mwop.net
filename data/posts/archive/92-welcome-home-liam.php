    Yesterday, after 14 days in the hospital, Liam came home!
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>
    He gained a full half-pound while in the NICU, eats like a horse, and is a
    sweet little man. We're all happy to have both him and Mommy back home;
    Maeve was particularly excited, and performed a little dance at daycare when
    I told her the whole family was home waiting for her.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you, everyone, for the support over the past two weeks! And welcome
    home, Liam!
