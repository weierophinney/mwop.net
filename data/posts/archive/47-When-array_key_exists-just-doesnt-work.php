    I've been playing with parameter testing in my various Cgiapp classes, and
    one test that seemed pretty slick was the following:
</p>
<pre>
    if (!array_key_exists('some_string', $_REQUEST)) {
        // some error
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Seems pretty straight-forward: $_REQUEST is an associative array, and I want
    to test for the existence of a key in it. Sure, I could use isset(), but it
    seemed...  ugly, and verbose, and a waste of keystrokes, particularly when
    I'm using the param() method:
</p>
<pre>
    if (!isset($_REQUEST[$this->param('some_param')])) {
        // some error
    }
</pre>
<p>
    However, I ran into a pitfall: when it comes to array_key_exists(),
    $_REQUEST isn't exactly an array. I think what's going on is that $_REQUEST
    is actually a superset of several other arrays -- $_POST, $_GET, and
    $_COOKIE -- and isset() has some logic to descend amongst the various keys,
    while array_key_exists() can only work on a single level.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever the explanation, I ended up reverting a bunch of code. :-(
