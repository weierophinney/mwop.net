<p>
    I've been wanting to do screencasts on Linux for some time now, and my big
    stumbling block has been determining what tools to use.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>tl;dr</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Use <code>recordMyDesktop</code> to record video clips, but afterwards, re-encode them
        to AVI (<a href="#script">see the script I used</a>)
    </li>

    <li>
        Record audio to WAV, or convert compressed audio to WAV format afterwards.
    </li>

    <li>
        Use OpenShot to stitch clips together and layer audio and video tracks.
    </li>

    <li>
        Remember to reset the video length if you change the playback rate.
    </li>

    <li>
        Export to a Web + Vimeo profile for best results.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1.1">Stumbling Blocks</h2>

<p>
<code>recordMyDesktop</code> is a fairly simple tool, and allows you to
record actions you're taking, and simultaneously capture audio. However, it
creates an ".ogv" (Ogg Vorbis video file) -- which is basically useless for
anybody not on Linux or FreeBSD. Additionally, I often like to record in
segments; this makes it less likely that I'll make mistakes, and, if I do, I
only need to record a small segment again, not the entire thing. <code>recordMyDesktop</code>
is only for creating screencasts, not merging them.
</p>

<p>
So, <code>recordMyDesktop</code> went into my toolbox for the purpose of recording the video
portion of my screencasts.
</p>

<p>
Which brings me to the next point: I also prefer to record the audio separately
from the screencast portion itself; this way I don't get typing sounds in the
recording, and I'm less likely to lose my train of thought as I'm speaking. 
To this end, I ended up using quite simply the "Sound Recorder" utility
(<code>gnome-sound-recorder</code>). It's not great, but with a reasonable microphone, it
gets the job done. I chose to record the audio as MP3 files.
</p>

<p>
However, this means that I now have video and audio tracks. So my toolbox needed
a utility for overlaying tracks and laying them out on a timeline independently.
</p>

<p>
I looked at a few different free tools for Linux, including <code>Avidemux</code>, <code>Cinelerra</code>,
and <code>PiTiVi</code>. <code>Avidemux</code> was not featurful enough, <code>Cinelerra</code> was too difficult to
learn (it's more of an advanced user's tool), and <code>PiTiVi</code> kept crashing on me.
So, I used the lazyweb, and tweeted a question asking what others were using --
and the unanimous response was <code>OpenShot</code> (<a href="http://www.openshotvideo.com/">http://www.openshotvideo.com/</a>).
</p>

<p>
<code>OpenShot</code> hit the sweet spot for me -- it was easy to pick up, and didn't crash.
However, I discovered problems when I exported my project to a video file. My
video, regardless of whether or not I changed the playback rate, always played
at about 2X normal speed. The audio always truncated 1 to 2 seconds before
completion.
</p>

<p>
In doing some research, I discovered:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
There are known issues with Ogg Vorbis video files. Evidently, the
   compression creates issues when re-encoding the video to another format.
</li>
<li>
Similarly, compressed audio can lead to issues such as truncation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since <code>recordMyDesktop</code> doesn't allow you to select an alternate video codec, I
had to use <code>mencoder</code> to transcode it to another format. I chose AVI (Audio
Video Interleave, a video container format developed by Microsoft), as I knew it
had widespread support, using an mpeg4 codec (also widely supported). I used the
following script, found at
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/17309/video-converter-ogv-to-avi-or-another-more-common-format">http://askubuntu.com/questions/17309/video-converter-ogv-to-avi-or-another-more-common-format</a>,
in order to encode my files:
</p>

<div id="script" class="example"><pre><code class="language-bash">
for f in *.ogv;do
newFile=${f%.*}
mencoder "$f" -o "$newFile.avi" -oac mp3lame -lameopts fast:preset=standard -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=4000
done
</code></pre></div>

<p>
That solved the video issue, but I still had to solve the audio issues. I
quickly re-recorded one audio segment in Sound Recorder, and told it to use the
"Voice,Lossless (.wav type)". When I used this version of the audio, I had no
issues, other than the audio length being mis-reported within <code>OpenShot</code>. Instead
of re-recording all segments, I installed the "Sound Converter" utility (`sudo
aptitude isntall soundconverter`), and used that to convert all my MP3 files to 
WAV. Interestingly, <code>OpenShot</code> reported the audio lengths correctly this time; go
figure.
</p>

<p>
Once that was done, I was able to start stitching everything together. A few
notes, in the hopes others learn from my mistakes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Several times, I wanted my video to playback slower. This is very easy to do:
   right click on the clip, select "Properties", and select the "Speed" tab, and
   adjust as necessary. However, that's not all you need to do; you need to also
   re-adjust the <em>length</em> of the clip. Simply take the existing length, and
   divide it by the rate of play. As an example, if the length is 44 seconds,
   and you specify a 1/2 rate (0.5), you'd do 44 / 0.5 = 88, and set the length
   of the clip to 88s.
</li>
<li>
If you find that <code>OpenShot</code> is reporting your audio clip lengths incorrectly,
   use another tool to find the accurate length, and then set the length to
   that. I typically rounded up to the next second, as most tools were giving
   the floor value from rounding.
</li>
<li>
I chose to export using the Web + Vimeo HD profile. This worked perfectly for
   me. It created an mpeg4 file that I could preview in a browser, and then
   upload without issues. Your mileage may vary.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hopefully, this will serve as a reasonable guide for others foraying into
screencasts on Linux!
