    Zend Server has a very cool
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch_v=i2XXn2SA5zM.html" target="_blank">Page Caching feature</a>. Basically, you can provide
    URLs or URL regular expressions, and tell Zend Server to provide full-page
    caching of those pages. This can provide a tremendous performance boost, without
    needing to change anything in your application structure; simply enable it for a
    set of pages, and sit back and relax.

    However, this feature is not entirely straight-forward when using a framework
    that provides its own routing, such as ZF2. The reason is because it assumes by
    default that each match maps to a specific file on the filesystem, and prepares
    the caching based on the actual <em>file</em> it hits. What this means for ZF2 and other
    similar frameworks is that any page that matches will return the cached version
    for the <em>first</em> match that also matches the same <em>file</em> -- i.e., <code>index.php</code> in
    ZF2. That's every page the framework handles. As an example, if I match on <code>/article/\d+</code>, it matches
    this to the file <code>index.php</code>, and then any other match that resolves to
    <code>index.php</code> gets served that same page. Not handy.
</p>

<p>
    The good part is that there's a way around this.
</p>

<p>
    When creating or modifying a caching rule, simply look for the text, "Create a
    separate cached page for each value of:" and click the "Add Parameter" button.
    Select <code>_SERVER</code> from the dropdown, and type <code>[REQUEST_URI]</code> for the value. Once
    saved, each page that matches the pattern will be cached separately.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Note: the <code>_SERVER</code> key may vary based on what environment/OS you're deployed
    in. Additionally, it may differ based on how you define rewrite rules -- some
    frameworks and CMS systems will append to the query string, for instance, in
    which case you may want to select the "entire query string" parameter instead of
    <code>_SERVER</code>; the point is, there's likely a way for you to configure it.
